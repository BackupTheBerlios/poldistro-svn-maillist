-
-09-13 Austin
-        Fixed : When a player dies, it will send SYSEVENT_DISENGAGED to the opponent-npc, if one is set.
-
-09-12 Shinigami
-        Added : some Packet functions, same as original one, but with flipping Byte Order
-                Packet.GetInt16Flipped(offset, value)
-                Packet.GetInt32Flipped(offset, value)

-
-09-10 Shinigami
-        Added : math::Root - returns y Root of x (same as Pow(x,1.0/y))
-
-09-08 Shinigami
-        Changed : eCompile - BASIC style for loops (for i:= start to end) will warn again on -v5 (and above)
-                  about the iteration variable being unused
-
-09-08 Austin

-
-09-03 Austin
-        Fixed : cfgfile::GetConfigStringArray() lines that contain a property name but no value will not be placed in the array.
-        Added : cfgfile::GetConfigStringDictionary( element, property_name ). Works similarly to
-                GetConfigStringArray() but will take the first word on the line and use it for the key.

-                {
-                       PropLine keyname this will be the text placed in it

-        Added   : Support for custom MIME types in config/www.cfg. This allows you to
-                  add new file types that the web server can handle, for example PNG images,
-                  PDF files or favicon.ico. If you don't supply a www.cfg, old defaults are used.
-        Hint    : Here's an example www.cfg:
-
-                MIME gif
-                {
-                    Extension gif

-	Added : Extended NPC.EM Say() function to allow for two additional parameters.
-		Say( text, text_type:=SAY_TEXTTYPE_DEFAULT, do_event:=SAY_DOEVENT_DISABLE );
-                Text type is a string &quot;default&quot;, &quot;yell&quot;, &quot;whisper&quot;, constants are:
-		SAY_TEXTTYPE_DEFAULT, SAY_TEXTTYPE_YELL, SAY_TEXTTYPE_WHISPER (added to npc.em)
-		If do_event is enabled with SAY_DOEVENT_ENABLE, it will send a speech event to nearby npcs.

-        Added : New flag for servspecopt.cfg called &quot;EventVisibilityCoreChecks&quot; set to 0 (disabled) by default.
-                Enabled - the core does visibility checks before sending events as it did before.
-                Disabled - requires your scripts do visibility checking. 
-
-08-22 Shinigami
-        Fixed : sometimes the Core crashed while destroying Items (e.g. via Control Scripts) on Boats
-
-07-28 Shinigami
-        Changed : eCompile - Assignment inside Condition Check will produce Warning on -v5 (and above) only
-
-07-26 Shinigami
-        Changed : TextCMDs can be specified in Packages; just make a commands/gm (new style) or
-                  textcmd/gm (old style) etc directory. These are only scanned at startup,
-                  so if the directory doesn't exist then, it won't be searched until restart.
-        Changed : Support for packaged Includes - if you use 'Include &quot;:blah:blubb&quot;;'
-                  eCompile will search for &quot;:blah:blubb.inc&quot; and &quot;:blah:include/blubb.inc&quot;.
-                  It will use first file found. If both files exist eCompile will print a Warning.
-
-07-25 Shinigami
-        Added : MinDamage and MaxDamage in weapon.GetItemDescriptor() calculated from Damage-Dice
-        Changed : usable Msg size of SendDialogGump doubled - now you can use larger Gumps

-                    WarningStaticsPerBlock    1000
-                    ShowIllegalGraphicWarning 1
-                }
-                it's a flag and defaults to 1 (for the other entries go to 07-05)
-
-07-07 Shinigami
-        Hint : uo::ListItems*Location, uo::ListMobile*Location and uo::ListStatics*Location
-               will check for out-of-range coords now
-               uo::ListObjectsInBox, uo::ListMultisInBox and uo::ListStaticsInBox
-               will NOT check for out-of-range coords - a lot of scripter &quot;love&quot; this bug :o/
-
-07-06 Shinigami
-        Fixed : u'll get the correct string representation even if a numeric Config File
-                Value will cause an overflow
-
-07-05 Shinigami
-        Added : Warning if no tiles or landtiles are loaded (maybe files missing...)

-                    WarningStaticsPerBlock 1000
-                }
-                max. Amount of Static Items per Block of 8x8x256 (or Warning Level)
-                it is hard limited to 10000. default is 1000.
-
-07-04 Shinigami
-        Changed : uo::ListStaticItemsAtLocation to uo::ListStaticsAtLocation( x, y, z, flags, realm )
-                  uo::ListStaticItemsNearLocation to uo::ListStaticsNearLocation( x, y, z, range, flags, realm )
-                  IGNORE_* constants to ITEMS_IGNORE_* constants
-        Added : Parameter Z in uo::ListStatics*Location
-        Added : LIST_IGNORE_Z constant u can use for Z Parameter to list all Items ignoring Z-Value
-                in uo::ListStatics*Location, uo::ListItems*Location and uo::ListMobilesNearLocation*
-        Added : uo::ListStaticsInBox( x1,y1,z1, x2,y2,z2, flags, realm );

-
-07-01 Shinigami
-        Fixed : low-fragmentation Heap is linked dynamically, so Core will work on Win9x/NT again

-                 You set intrinsic Mod via exported GetIntrinsicModFunction in attributes.cfg
-        Fixed : Memory leak inside cfgfile::Read-/UnloadConfigFile(...)
-                cfgfile::AppendConfigFile(...) will call cfgfile::UnloadConfigFile(...) immediately
-
-06-15 Shinigami
-        Added : npc::CanMove( direction ) - checks if an NPC can move in given direction
-                (IsLegalMove works in a different way and is used for bounding boxes only)

-        Added : uo::Attach( character ) - attach a Script to a Character
-        Fixed : moving intrinsic Weapon via MoveItemToLocation crashed Server
-                WARNING: You should never touch intrinsic Weapons!
-        Added : uo::ListStaticItemsAtLocation( x, y, flags, realm )
-        Added : uo::ListStaticItemsNearLocation( x, y, range, flags, realm )
-                creates an array of structures with Static and Multi Items at or around location.
-                you can specify via flags which Items you want to get. check IGNORE_* constants.

-        Added : uo::GetStandingLayers( x, y, flags, realm )
-                get an array of standing layers and blocking solids. check MAPDATA_FLAG_* constants.
-
-05-31 Shinigami
-        Added : flag LOG_DATETIME in file::LogToFile( filename, line, flags := 0 )
-                to log Core-Style DateTimeStr in front of log entry
-                
-05-28 Shinigami

-        Added : Account.split( newacctname : string, index : 1..5 )
-                create a new account and move character to it
-        Added : Account.move_char( destacctname : string, index : 1..5 )
-                move character from this account to destination account.
-                you can use it to flip chars on same account too - it's not a bug, it's a feature ;oP
-
-04-04 Shinigami
-        Added : player.createdat - returns the PolClock when the character was created
-        Added : Before character deletion, scripts/misc/candelete.ecl will be called.
-                  program definition is:
-                    - program can_delete( who, deleteby ); // return nonzero to allow deletion
-                  new constants in UO.EM:
-                    - DELETE_BY_PLAYER : Delete-Request by Player
-                    - DELETE_BY_SCRIPT : Delete-Request by account.DeleteCharacter( index )
-                Before character deletion, scripts/misc/ondelete.ecl and anypkg/ondelete.ecl will be called.
-                  Their return values are ignored.
-        Fixed : Call OnDelete script in account.DeleteCharacter( index ) too.
-        Updated : Account.set_uo_expansion(string): recognized values: SE, AOS, LBR, T2A (default), &quot;&quot;.
-                    This determines what flag is sent with packet 0xB9 during login
-                      (Nothing -&gt; 0x0000 / T2A -&gt; 0x0001 / LBR -&gt; 0x0002 / AOS -&gt; 0x801b / SE -&gt; 0x805b).
-                    It's possible to hook 0xB9 but don't forget to set_uo_expansion anyway because core
-                    uses this for internal flags (e.g. AoS Tooltips). Packet 0xB9 will be sent earlier
-                    (before you choose a character) and after you've used set_uo_expansion.
-        Updated : servspecopt.cfg property: UOFeatureEnable, used in the last dword of the 0xA9 login packet,
-                  will block Bit 6 (support up to 6 Chars).
-                  To enable AoS stuff set Bit 5 (use 0x20), to enable SE stuff set Bit 7 &amp; 5 (use 0xa0). 
-
-04-02 Shinigami
-        Added : Additional realm-support
-                  CreateItemCopyAtLocation(x, y, z, item, realm := _DEFAULT_REALM);
-                  boat.move_offline_mobiles(int x, int y, int z[, string realm]);
-                    (If realm is not set, Boat-realm is used.)
-        Added : Some realm-constants to uo.em
-
-03-05 Shinigami
-        Added : UseTileFlagPrefix=0|1 in SERVSPECOPT(.LOCAL).CFG (default = 1)
-                Should Core prepend &quot;a&quot;/&quot;an&quot; according to tiles.cfg flags to formatted item names?
-                (p.s.: in 08-29 renamed from UseAAnTileFlags to UseTileFlagPrefix)
-        Fixed : Last but not least, remove Spell Delay usage from core.
-
-03-03 Madman
-        Fixed : My previous attempt to remove spellcasting from the core was incomplete. It should no
-                  longer run a skillcheck before starting the spell script.
-
-03-02 Shinigami
-        Fixed : MoveObjectToRealm will handle any type of items (equipment etc.) and container with content too.
-        Fixed : You can move item from container to different realm without crash.
-
-03-01 Shinigami
-        Fixed : Pol will support up to 5 Maps now (Britannia, Britannia_alt, Ilshenar, Malas, Tokuno)
-
-02-23 Shinigami
-        Added : DecayItems=0|1 in SERVSPECOPT(.LOCAL).CFG (default = 1)
-                Disable (e.g. World Design Server) or enable (Live Shard Server) item decay.
-
-02-14 Shinigami
-        Fixed : AOS Spellbook entries in itemdesc.cfg will not crash linux build anymore.
-        Fixed : Wrong handling of double clicking AoS style Spellbooks.
-
-01-27 Shinigami
-        Fixed : UOConvert will convert Samurai Empire Map Tokuno.
-                Don't forget to use tiledata.mul shipped with SE.
-                Don't forget to build new tiles.cfg and landtiles.cfg too.
-                If not, your Tokuno Realm works and maybe looks funny ;o)
-        Fixed : Small bug within UOConvert and Tiledata names with full length.
-
-01-24 Shinigami
-        Added : player.clientinfo -- returns a struct with a lot of usefull infomation about client PC
-                Example :
-
-                Function TestClientInfo(who)
-                  Var info:=who.clientinfo;
-
-                  If (info.unknown1) // in most/all cases 0x02
-                    SysLog(&quot;ClientInfo '&quot;+who.name+&quot;' [&quot;+who.acctname+&quot;]&quot;);
-                    SysLog(&quot;  Unknown1                 = &quot;+Lower(Hex(info.unknown1)));
-                    SysLog(&quot;  Unique Instance ID of UO = &quot;+Lower(Hex(info.instance)));
-                    SysLog(&quot;  OS Version               = &quot;+info.os_major+&quot;.&quot;+info.os_minor+&quot;.&quot;+info.os_revision);
-                    SysLog(&quot;  CPU Manufacturer         = &quot;+info.cpu_manufacturer);
-                    SysLog(&quot;  CPU Family               = &quot;+info.cpu_family);
-                    SysLog(&quot;  CPU Model                = &quot;+info.cpu_model);

-                Limitations :
-                  The client doesn't send this Packet every time,
-                    if available you can use it first time in your misc/logon.src.
-                  If your login server differs from play/shard server it doesn't work
-                    (Packet will be send before you choose the server only).
-                  This will work for Win release only, until now. Win and Linux core
-                    handle server-choose- and play-connection in a different way.
-                    Not sure why, must be something with OS-Socks implementation :o(
-
-                Comment :
-                  Seems to be very usefull to detect shadow accounts...

-        Linux : If you'll get something like this using Gentoo Release:
-
-                  pol: ../sysdeps/generic/dl-tls.c:72: _dl_next_tls_modid:
-                    Assertion `result &lt;= _dl_tls_max_dtv_idx' failed.

-09-18 Birdy
-        Fixed : Moved login complete packet send higher in login process to try to fix
-                problems with logging into a weather region with weather where it would
-                start to rain spell icons instead of rain or snow.
-
-08-03 Birdy
-        Added : AcctMatch lines in server entries in servers.cfg.  Example of format
-                is below.  AcctMatch lines have one account name per line, and are
-                those accounts to show the given server to on login to the
-                'login server'(the server that is in the client's login.cfg).
-                Example :
-
-                GameServer
-                {
-                    Name      Test
-                    IP        192.168.0.1
-                    Port      5003
-                    AcctMatch admin
-                    AcctMatch staff
-                }
-
-                The above would only display that particular server(Test, located at
-                192.168.0.1:5003) to someone logging into the login server with
-                accounts admin or staff.
-
-                IPMatch still works as well, and for an account to see the server it
-                must fulfill both IPMatch and AcctMatch entries, if those exist to
-                match up against.
-
-08-03 Birdy
-        Fixed : Good Aligned NPCs that attack innocents and go criminal will
-                highlight grey now.
-                Attacking criminal flagged Good NPCs will no longer flag others as
-                criminal.
-
-08-01 Birdy
-        Fixed : Crash bug related to realm not being set in createitemincontainer soon
-                enough for references to it in create scripts.
-
-07-27 Birdy
-        Added : New system event : SYSEVENT_GONE_CRIMINAL := 0x2000;
-                You should add this to your sysevent.inc file or wherever you keep your
-                system event constants.  This event is closely associated with the
-                SYSEVENT_ENTERED_AREA event.  It uses the current range setting for
-                the ENTERED_AREA event as it's own range, and this is for good reason.
-                The GONE_CRIMINAL event lets the system tell the NPC when a mobile has
-                become a criminal(from a previously non-criminal state) by firing this
-                event and placing a character reference to the new criminal in the
-                source field of the event. If used in conjunction with the ENTERED_AREA
-                system event, then guards should be able to do their guarding work
-                without needing to do polling scans of the area around them periodically.
-                On ENTERED_AREA events, you check to see if the person entering the area
-                is a criminal or not.  On GONE_CRIMINAL events, you know that the person
-                who was already in the area has become a criminal from previously being
-                innocent.
-
-                This event will only fire if the criminal is visible to the NPC.  Though
-                again, if you are using it in conjunction with the ENTERED_AREA event, then
-                when the criminal comes out of hiding, an ENTERED_AREA event will be fired
-                and you can handle the criminal there.
-
-                This event will also only fire on transitions from innocent status to
-                criminal status.  No events will fire on transition to innocent status
-                again, and if the subject was already a criminal to begin with, then
-                doing a criminal act again will not fire the event.  This is to keep the
-                system from being overloaded with events since every hit on an innocent
-                is a new criminal act.
-
-                I will stress one last time, use this WITH the SYSEVENT_ENTERED_AREA
-                system event, NOT on it's own!  Or you will be confused and bewildered.
-                You have been warned!

-07-18 Madman Across the Water
-        Changed: Casting from the default spellbook:
-               * It no longer checks if you are dead, says the words of power,
-                 performs the animations, checks for free hands, performs a
-                 skill check, or checks for or consumes mana or reagents. All
-                 these things must now be handled in scripts. This, combined
-                 with Myrathi's changes on 5-12, wherein spellid is now passed
-                 to the cast spell, should allow greater flexibility and also
-                 simplicity in spell systems and scripts.
-
-06-17 Birdy
-        Changed: Uncommented RandomFloat(...) in util.em to allow it to be used.
-
-06-13 Birdy
-        Fixed: Items dragged across realms and dropped will update properly.  This
-               is necessary to allow storage containers to be able to have their items
-               dragged out of them and dropped on the ground directly, even if the
-               ground is not the default realm that storage containers are all in.
-        Fixed: All worn items will now have their realm updated on character realm
-               transfer instead of just the backpack.
-
-06-09 Myrathi
-        Removed: Deprecated UO.EM functions:
-               * Damage()
-               * GameStat()
-
-06-08 Myrathi
-        Fixed: CASE statements given a significant overhaul:
-               * Error messages now correctly refer to them as a &quot;CASE statement&quot;,
-                 not a &quot;SWITCH statement&quot;.
-               * They now *require* their test-expression to be within parenthesis.
-               * Empty CASE statements with no option clauses are now caught as
-                 invalid.
-               * A warning message will be displayed if the only thing defined is
-                 a &quot;default:&quot; clause (i.e. no option clauses)
-               * Missing option values are now caught and less cryptic error messages
-                 shown (e.g. when using undefined constants)
-
-06-06 Myrathi
-        Added: New 'dowhile' keyword (to solve the &quot;do/while()/endwhile/while()&quot;
-               bug). &quot;do..dowhile()&quot; now follows the more usual block syntax
-               style (if..endif, while..endwhile, etc.).
-               Syntax is as follows:
-
-                   do
-                     &lt;statements&gt;
-                   dowhile ( &lt;expression-is-true&gt; );
-
-06-05 Birdy
-        Added: ItemColorMask ServerSpecOpt option.  This option defaults to the
-               typical POL mask of 0xFFF.  It is a bitmask of what colors should
-               be considered valid.  For example, with an ItemColorMask of
-               0xFFF, any color from 0 to 4095 is considered a valid color.
-               With an ItemColorMask of 0xFF, this would be reduced to a range
-               from 0 to 255.  It was left a mask instead of given as a range
-               in order to allow specifying certain bits to be on.  So, for
-               instance, with the newer clients, a mask of 0x4FFF will allow
-               the third bit (value 4) of the most significant nibble to
-               be turned on, but no others in that nibble.  This allows for
-               newer clients to use the &quot;transparent animation&quot; feature, which
-               allows equipped mounts to be transparent(ie, ethereals).  Bear
-               in mind, older clients may well crash if you set colors to be
-               outside of the non-default mask of 0xFFF, so this is strictly at
-               your own risk to use it.  But for those of you wishing ethereal
-               beetles and other mount animations to be ethereal, you will have
-               to set the mount piece to be color 0x4001 and then equip it.
-               And in order to do that, you will need an ItemColorMask of
-               0x4FFF.
-
-06-03 Birdy
-        Removed: GetAttributeIntrinsicMod(...) function interface in uo.em was
-                 removed, since no Set for the function has existed since way
-                 back in POL094 test cores and no plans to impliment a set
-                 exist.  This will require a search of your scripts for this
-                 function and removal of it(some distro code has it) and
-                 a recompile of those scripts.
-
-05-24 Birdy
-        Fixed: FindSubstance should now (hopefully) auto-release items reserved by
-               it on script termination.
-        Fixed: Packet.SendAreaPacket(x,y,range,realm) now looks for 4 parameters
-               as it should instead of 3.
-
-05-17 Birdy
-        Changed: concealed property is no longer compared to cmdlevel by core.  Any
-                 scripts changing concealed should do validation against cmdlevel
-                 itself.  Doing this now allows NPCs and others to be able to be
-                 concealed at higher levels than their cmdlevel.  For this added
-                 flexibility, all validation must now be done within scripts!
-
-05-16 Myrathi
-    Removed deprecated operators and tokens (as promised! :P'):
-        - '=' has been removed; use '==' to test for equality.
-          (appropriate suggestions will be made for '==' or ':=')
-        - 'local', 'global' and 'dim' have been removed; use 'var' to declare variables.
-        - 'begin' and 'end' have been removed:
-			do..while() loops now work without them.
-			repeat..until() loops never actually needed them: so no loss. :)
-
-        ** Scripts containing any of the removed operators or tokens **
-        **     WILL NOT COMPILE ANY MORE!! Update your scripts!!     **
-
-05-12 Myrathi
-	Fixed: Mobile 'mob.frozen' flag is now saved properly (NOTE: this includes PCs and
-		will most likely require any existing scripted workarounds to be rewritten!)
-
-	Added: Extra 'spell_id' parameter is now passed to spell scripts which relates to
-		'SPELLID' in the spell's entry in '::spells.cfg'.
-
-		Example:
-			use uo;
-			program spellscript( who, spell_id )
-				SendSysMessage(who, &quot;Casting SPELLID# &quot; + CStr(spell_id));
-				// &quot;Clumsy&quot; has spell_id = 1, &quot;Create Food&quot; = 2, etc..
-			endprogram
-
-05-01 Birdy
-	Fixed: Number of Map/Static patches was reversed in the enable difs packet.
-
-05-01 Racalac
-    Fixed CProps &quot;GivenBy&quot;, &quot;GivenTo&quot;, and &quot;GivenTime&quot; set on items dropped on NPCs.
-
-04-26 Birdy
-    Added: New uo.em function created :
-        FindSubstance( container, objtype, amount, makeinuse := 0 )
-        This function will search the given container for items of objtype in an
-        amount equal or greater than the amount given(stackables can return greater
-        than #), if makeinuse is set to 1, then the items will be reserved.  If
-        sufficient # of items have been found, those found(and possibly reserved)
-        will be returned in an array as the return value.  If not enough of the
-        given item were found, then an error with errortext = &quot;Not enough of that
-        substance in container&quot; will be returned.
-
-04-25 Racalac
-    Added new house methods that allow write access to the house.components array.
-        house.add_component(item ref)
-        house.erase_component(item ref)
-    Added multi member:
-        multi.footprint
-            returns a struct with &quot;xmin&quot;, &quot;xmax&quot;, &quot;ymin&quot;, &quot;ymax&quot; of the world coordinates
-            the house or boat occupies.
-    Added GetMultiDimensions(graphic), returns struct with &quot;xmin&quot;, &quot;xmax&quot;, &quot;ymin&quot;, &quot;ymax&quot;
-        of _relative_ distances from center. xmin and ymin are _negative_.
-    Changed TargetMultiPlacement. new optional parameters:
-        TargetMultiPlacement( character, objtype, flags := 0, xoffset := 0, yoffset := 0 );
-        xoffset and yoffset change the &quot;ghost&quot; target house. NOTE: the coordinates returned
-        by this are the coordinates of the &quot;target&quot; cursor, not the center of the house!
-        So if you want to have the front steps be under the cursor, you must transform the
-        parameters to CreateMultiAtLocation to include your xoffset and yoffset. ANOTHER
-        NOTE: positive offsets move the cursor left/down in relation to the ghost house.
-        When transforming the coordinates for CreateMultiAtLocation, use the negative (i.e
-        if yoffset is 4, subtract 4 from the y coordinate result of TargetMultiPlacement
-        when passing the location to CreateMultiAtLocation.
-        Example, using the front steps to target:
-            var dims := GetMultiDimensions( 0x6071 );
-            if(!dims) return; endif
-            var loc := TargetMultiPlacement( who, 0x6071, 0, 0, dims.ymax );
-            if(!loc) return; endif
-            var house := CreateMultiAtLocation( loc.x, loc.y - dims.ymax, loc.z, 0x6071, 0, who.realm );
-
-
-04-24 Racalac
-    Armor Zone 0 errors hae a better message now.
-    Half-created PCs shouldn't get into the world file now.
-    Added house.custom() returns 1/0 (for upcoming custom house support)
-    NPC move functions check the current realm's bounds
-    CreateItemAtLocation correctly checks passed coordinates for validity for the realm
-    Map methods (insertpin, etc) check the current realm's bounds. Not like there's art for
-        the other realms anyway.
-    Packet 0x1B changed to include correct map/server bounds
-
-04-23 Birdy
-	Changed: Mounts listed in uoconvert.cfg that are not found to have tiledata.mul
-		entries will now be created regardless.  Should fix problems related to
-		0x3ea2 mount(perhaps others too), which has no tiledata.mul entry, yet
-		is a valid mount graphic.
-
-04-20 Birdy
-	Fixed: FindPath(...) should work again now.
-
-04-17 Birdy
-	Changed: Speech.mul -- Added in support for UTF-8 -&gt; Unicode decoding in speech.mul
-		packets.  Should work now (hopefully) for all languages.
-	Fixed: Minor tweaks to movement.  Should fix some bounceback problems.
-
-04-17 Racalac
-	Multimap/Realm Support
-	----------------------
-	POL now supports seperate maps, or &quot;Realms&quot;, such as britannia, ilshenar,
-	and malas. The uoconvert tool is the starting point for using realms on
-	your shard. Run the updated instructions in the included uoconvert.txt
-	help file. The names of the directories created in pol/realms by uoconvert
-	are the realm names that are used by the core and your scripts. I
-	recommend you keep them the same as what is in the uoconvert.txt file.
-	Realm names are the key to using realms on your shard.
-
-	The client's *.dif files should be used in the uoconvert process, as the
-	client needs to know how many patches exist. Any time the .dif files
-	change on the client side, re-run uoconvert with the new .dif files to
-	stay in sync.
-
-
-	Object Changes:
-	UObject.realm: Read-only string. (This inherits to Item, Character, Multi, etc)
-
-	Account.uo_expansion: Read-only string
-	Account.set_uo_expansion(string): recognized values: AOS, LBR, T2A (default)
-	  This determines what flag is sent with packet 0xB9 during login. The
-	  servspecopt.cfg UOFeatureEnable is used with packet 0xA9 and is currently
-	  global to all clients.
-
-	Packet.SendAreaPacket(x,y,range,realm), realm name string parameter added.
-
-	Escript Module Changes:
-	polsys.em:
-		Added &quot;Realms()&quot;: returns a dictionary of structs. example:
-			&quot;realm_name&quot; -&gt; &quot;width&quot;
-						    &quot;height&quot;
-						    &quot;mapid&quot;
-						    &quot;toplevel_item_count&quot;
-						    &quot;mobile_count&quot;
-
-	uo.em (included with zip):
-	The following functions were enhanced with a realm parameter (all realm
-	parameters are a case-sensative string name of the realm). All other
-	functions use some object's context for determining the realm.
-
-	Tip for upgrading: all your scripts should works normall _in Britannia_.
-	In any other realm they will fail. You must find all occurances of these
-	functions on your shard and fill in the realm parameter with an appropriate
-	value. For example, in the createnpc textcommand, the call to
-	CreateNPCAtLocation should be made with 'who.realm' as the last parameter.
-	Many script changes are easy like this, others are harder, like
-	spawnregion and recall/gate spells. If something doesn't work, you can be
-	fairly sure it's due to an incorrect realm parameter. The pol-distro
-	sourceforge project has been updated with many of these changes if you
-	wish to look.

-	number of map and static patches (from mapdif and stadif files) saved to
-	   /realm/[name]/realm.cfg
-	Recommend to turn on mapdifs for all realms.
-
-
-	Other Changes:
-	AOS Spellbook packets are supported. For this, change you spellbook's
-	itemdesc.cfg type from Container to Spellbook. Paladin and Necromancer
-	spellbooks are supported by the new Spellbook itemdesc type property
-	&quot;SpellType&quot; which is one of these strings: &quot;Magic&quot;, &quot;Paladin&quot;, &quot;Necro&quot;.
-
-	Recognized scroll objects are: Magic: 0x1F2D - 0x1F6C, Necro 0x2260 - 0x226F,
-	    Paladin: 0x2270 - 0x227C. Sorry this is hardcoded :P
-
-	Simple support for AOS tooltips - old single click functionality is supported.
-
-	Custom Houses - not yet sorry, that's next!

-04-01 Birdy
-	Added: 	MaxPathFindRange servspecopt[.local].cfg option added.  This will define the
-			maximum distance between the start and destination points which pathfinding
-			will be performed on.  If PathFind is called on points greater than this
-			value, an error result will be returned with &quot;Beyond Max Range.&quot; as the
-			errortext.  Default value for this is 50.
-	Added:	HiddenTurnsCount servspecopt[.local].cfg option added.  This will define
-			whether or not turns made while hidden will count as a &quot;move&quot;.  It defaults
-			to 1, which is the way POL has always operated.  If set to zero, then if
-			you are hidden and make a turn, it will not count against your stealth steps,
-			nor will it unhide you if you are not stealthing.  If set to one, turns while
-			hidden do count against stealthsteps, and will unhide you if you are not
-			stealthing.
-	Added:  New uo.em function added, UseItem(item, character);  This will allow the
-			item specified's use script to be run by the character specified.  No checks
-			are done for distance, or check for being a ghost, or anything else.
-			Essentially, the script is just fired off on the character without checks, so
-			the script calling this function should do those checks if desired.  This
-			function can also be called with NPC's as the character, but any use script
-			that requires interactivity with it's user that is called on an NPC may have
-			unpredictable results(dependant on the script).
-	Added:  UOConvert now will report the (x,y,z) of invalid tiles that cause it to
-			abort map conversion instead of just aborting.
-
-03-29 Birdy
-	Fixed: Caves should now be able to be walked into.  Some problems along shores fixed too.
-			Run UOconvert on your files for this fix to work.
-
-03-24 Birdy
-	Changed: Character height in all other aspects changed to 15 from 9 to better reflect height in
-			 game relative to items.
-	Changed: Walking related to ladders modified to try to help in their traversal.
-	Changed: The map now should block LOS.  Run UOconvert on all your files again! (see uoconvert.txt
-			 for instructions)
-	Fixed: Speech.mul should now display speech with keywords even when on a non-ENU region computer.
-	Changed: Boats now check height of blockables in relation to the boat before being
-			 blocked by them.  This should allow boats to travel under sufficiently high
-			 bridges and over statics that may be under the map.
-	Added: Pathfinding function FindPath.  This is a very experimental function and has a minute
-			chance of returning a &quot;Path Corrupted&quot; error.  If you use it and can find a distinct
-			path from point A to point B which generates a &quot;Path Corrupted&quot; error, please send
-			details to the dev team.
-
-			Function prototype is found in uo.em and takes the form :
-
-			FindPath( x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2, realm := _DEFAULT_REALM, mobilesblock := 0, searchskirt := 5 );
-
-			(x1,y1,z1) = start of the path
-			(x2,y2,z2) = destination
-			mobilesblock = Whether or not to consider mobiles in the way as 'blocking' the path.
-			searchskirt = The skirt around the square that is formed around the start of the path
-						  to the destination which represents the searchable area.
-
-			If it finds a path it will return an array of coordinates, representing each step
-			along the path from the next step to take from the start of the path to the actual
-			destination.  The coordinates are found in .x, .y, and .z.  Ex :
-
-			myPath := FindPath(startx, starty, startz, endx, endy, endz);
-
-			The first step to take from a standing position at (startx,starty,startz) would be
-			at (myPath[1].x, myPath[1].y, myPath[1].z), the next at (myPath[2].x, myPath[2].y,
-			myPath[2].z), etc.
-
-			Keep in mind that if you want you can give as large a search area as you want, and
-			it will try to find the area.  But the larger the search area(ie, the larger the
-			distance from start to destination), the more memory and more time it will take to
-			find a path.  Trying to search, for instance, for a path from Yew to Britain will
-			almost certainly freeze your shard and gobble up all it's memory.  No restrictions
-			were placed in core in order to allow for use of the function with future computers
-			which may indeed one day be able to search for such a path in a split second.  But
-			that leaves the responsibility on the scripter using the function to be certain to
-			not try to search for outrageously large paths.  My experience is that paths of
-			20 or less tiles are fairly quick and low impact on the server.
-
-			Several errors can be returned instead, with the following errortext messages :
-
-			&quot;Failed to find a path.&quot;  --  The typical error returned when a path hasn't been found.
-			&quot;Out of memory.&quot;          --  This will only happen if there isn't sufficient memory to perform the search.
-			&quot;Solution Corrupted!&quot;     --  This is an error that rarely seems to happen, but if you can get it to
-										  happen repeatedly along a static(non-changing) specific path, please
-										  report it to <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/poldistro-svn">birdy at polserver.com</A>
-			&quot;Pathfind Error.&quot;         --  A catch-all error for various other circumstances, assume no path could be found.
-
-&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1.192.4.30
-03-04 Birdy
-	Changed: Character look height changed to 15 from 9 to better reflect height in game relative
-			to items.
-	Added: uoconvert.cfg element option added, LOSOptions, in the following form:
-				LOSOptions
-				{
-					UseNoShoot        1
-					LOSThroughWindows 1
-				}
-			UseNoShoot means uoconvert will determine whether or not something blocks LOS by use of
-			the NoShoot tiledata flag instead of the Blocking tiledata flag.  A couple of special
-			cases exist for secret door items and blocking items that are walls(in both cases, LOS
-			will be hindered), but otherwise the NoShoot tiledata flag will be used.  This should
-			make many blocking, yet not really LOS blocking items no longer block sight, such as
-			candelabras, lamp posts, and such.
-			LOSThroughWindows only matters if UseNoShoot is 1.  If LOSThroughWindows is 1, then
-			items marked as windows in tiledata will not impede LOS.
-			Both of these options default to false.  When UseNoShoot is false, the old method of
-			determining sight blocking as being equivalent to ability to pass will be used for LOS.
-	Added: uoconvert.cfg element option added, Mounts, in the following form:
-				Mounts
-				{
-					Tiles  0x3ea0 0x3ea1 0x3ea2 0x3ea3 0x3ea4 0x3ea5 0x3ea6 0x3ea8 0x3ea9 0x3eb0 0x3eb2 0x3eb3 0x3e9f
-				}
-			If this element exists, and if Tiles exist within it, then those tiles with the graphic IDs
-			listed will be considered to be mounts by uoconvert and will set the layer to be the
-			mount layer and it will set the tile to be equippable.
-
-	Added: New System Hook : SpeechMul -- This hook will be activated when someone using a client with speech.mul
-			in it says a speech.mul keyword(one or more).  The person who spoke is passed as the first parameter
-			and an array containing each of the speech tokens they spoke is passed as the second parameter.
-			This is a very experimental hook, so use at your own risk!  Though I would like to know if it works,
-			particularly on non-english systems.  For ENU players/admins, whether you have a hook or not, these
-			changes should make it such that you no longer &quot;lose text&quot; that has speech.mul tokens in it.
-
-			If you wish to write a syshook script for speech.mul tokens, you will need a syshook.cfg file with
-			the following in it.  This should be in a package of some sort too of course.
-
-				SystemHookScript speechmulhook.ecl
-				{
-					SpeechMul SpeechMul
-				}
-
-			The following is an example of a very simple hook called speechmulhook.src.  It is, of course, up to
-			you to make something actually useful. :
-
-				use uo;
-
-				program SpeechMulHook()
-				    return 1; //change to 1 to enable the hook
-				endprogram
-
-				exported function SpeechMul(who, speechtokens) //note passed ARRAY of speech.mul tokens
-
-				    Print(&quot;Tokens : &quot;);
-				    foreach token in speechtokens
-						Print(CStr(token));
-					endforeach
-
-				endfunction
-
-12-27 Racalac
-    Fixed invisible corpse clothing
-    Fixed boat member access
-    Fixed (maybe) first non-nodraw tile in multi definition flagged as static by uoconvert
-    Changed core visibility function - characters now can always see themselves. Fix for
-        equipping items while hidden not showing until unhiding.
-
-12-06 Racalac
-    Fixed: Invisible items in containers caused random items to become temporarily invisible
-    Fixed: default doubleclick range for items without an itemdesc entry wasn't reading from servspecopt.cfg
-
-11-16 Racalac
-    Fixed: member access to account and script objects (and any dicts/structs with the same key names)
-        Recompile your scripts! Keep testing, find my errors! :)
-    Changed: logged-off players are now considered not visible for any/all systems that check visibility.
-
-11-15 Racalac
-    poltool: prints flag descriptions
-    Fixed: height 1 &quot;half-height&quot; tiles no longer considered height 0.
-    Fixed: crash by passing 0 to SystemFindBoatBySerial
-    Fixed: account object method fall-through. d'oh!
-
-11-10 Racalac
-    Fixed member access to datastore, script, and guild objects. Keep testing!
-    Changed: equipment.container returns an &quot;offline&quot; character reference when equipped.
-
-11-09 Racalac
-    Changed: invisible items in containers can't be seen by those without the seeinvisitems priv
-    Major Changes: New ecompile version! Changed the way object methods and members are set and get.
-        This should give a moderate to major speed enhancement to script execution. Please report
-        any weirdness you encounter with respect to setting and getting object (and struct/dict)
-        members, calling object methods, and methodscripts (that may or may not override core-defined
-        methods).
-        Temporary new ecompile/ecompile.cfg option: specifiy the -m command-line paramter to compile
-            using the old way, or set &quot;OptimizeObjectMembers&quot; in ecompile.cfg to 0 (1 by default).
-            This option will go away when I'm satisfied this new code works.
-
-11-01 Racalac (not in 11-01 test core)
-    Fixed: water statics above walkable map no longer blocks movement below
-    Fixed: second equipped item in a layer no longer stored as &quot;gotten&quot; (fixes crash on save?)
-
-10-31 Racalac
-    Items with no defined itemdesc.cfg entry (walls, floors, etc) will use the
-        servspecopt.cfg values for decay time and dblclickrange.
-    Added character.cleargottenitem(). Returns &quot;dragged&quot; item to original
-        location. There's an graphical glitch with the client that makes it
-        look like the item is duplicated. The item that appears to remain on
-        the cursor is not really there.
-    uoconvert: changed map structure to allow building dynamic items and walking
-        around on them. RECONVERT YOUR MAP!
-    Allowed movement in places like T2A with dramatic Z changes in the map.
-    Fixed: certain script parameters were being flagged wrongly as out-of-range
-    Fixed: (maybe) If a layer is already equipped, trying to equip another item
-        on that layer will return the item to its original location (3D client thing).
-    Added Npcdesc.cfg property: AttackAnimation (default 0 (wrestling)), use this
-         change the template's intrinsic weapon animation (i.e. for LBR npcs)
-
-10-25 Racalac
-	Added uoconvert.cfg for defining what multi IDs are what type (Boat, House, Stairs (AOS)). See included file for 'normal' values.
-	Added for Packet Hooks: SubCommandLength property for 'parent' packets: 1, 2, or 4 byte lengths for subcommand fields.
-		Example:
-		Packet 0x12 //Macro/Spell/Action
-		{
-			Length variable
-			SubCommandOffset 3
-			SubCommandLength 1 //unlike cmd BF, the subcommand is 1 byte, not 2
-		}
-		SubPacket 0x12
-		{
-			SubCommandID 0xC7 //bow or salute
-			ReceiveFunction command_12:HandleC7Action
-		}
-
-09-27 Racalac
-    Fixed improper cleanup of accounts and player characters on exit, leftovers.txt should be reduced in size now.
-    Maybe fixed a memory leak in the packet hook system.
-
-09-08 Racalac
-    Fixed a crash condition concerning multis and movement.
-    Added error messages if missing realm files.
-
-    uoconvert: handles a specific poorly formed staidx block
-
-09-06 Racalac
-    uotool reads pol.cfg from the same dir to find the MUL files.
-    uotool &amp; poltool usage statements updated
-    Example to fix mounts, add en entry like this in tiles.cfg for each of your mount types (i.e. listed in tamed.src)
-    Remember running &quot;uoconvert tiles&quot; will not save your manual changes.
-    tile 0x3ea2
-    {
-        Desc mount
-        UoFlags 0x04404000
-        Layer 25
-        Height 3
-        Weight 0
-        Equippable 1
-        Movable 1
-    }
-    Changed UOConvert handling of blocking flags, probably fixing NPCs walking through fences, etc. Please re-run UOconvert.
-    Syz changed uoconvert to be more friendly to tool-created map and statics MULs.
-
-08-21 Racalac
-    Turned off core sends of Packet oxB9 (UO expansion enable) for now, it will return!
-    Fixed bug with CreatePacket with specified cmdtype with fixed-length.
-
-08-20 Racalac
-    Fixed a bug in multis walking code introduced in the 08-19 testcore.
-
-08-16 Syzygy
-    The 'Summon Water Elemental' spell must now be in the spellbook to be cast.
-
-08-14 Syzygy
-    Fixed a LOS issue when doubleclicking an item stored in an NPC's backpack
-
-08-13 Syzygy
-    corrected an error where a client could be redirected to the wrong server if servers.cfg specified 'IPMatch' directives.
-    corrected an error which would not allow a mob to drop an item to a lower Z.
-    at death, those added to your &quot;reportable&quot; list will no longer be marked aggressor to you.
-    at death, those added to your &quot;reportable&quot; list will no longer be marked as having lawfully damaged you.
-      (this is imperfect - all your aggressors, and lawful damagers, should be cleared at your death)
-
-08-09 Syzygy
-    pol.exe no longer uses .mul files.  See uoconvert.txt for notes (you will use uoconvert to generate pol data files)
-      notable changes:
-         a door will only be ignored if its itemdesc entry says it's a door
-           (previously, used the tiledata.mul &quot;door&quot; flag to tell)
-      I do not recommend editing multis.cfg, tiles.cfg, or landtiles.cfg by hand - as uoconvert is young, it's likely
-      that you'll have to regenerate these files from the .mul files soon.
-
-08-05 Syzygy
-    Removed 'UseDynamicMapCache' pol.cfg option and related code
-
-07-27 Syzygy
-    CreateNpcFromTemplate will now accept a struct, or an array (with element names), specifying custom properties
-
-07-26 Racalac
-    Fixed creating armor items with GetItemDescriptor
-    Added: Packet Hook Scripts. See packethooks.txt. Don't try to hook AOS packets or I'll cry.
-
-06-20 Syzygy
-    account.GetCharacter(index) will notice if you pass 0, which is bad.
-        account.DeleteCharacter(index) - same
-
--- POL095 --
-07-03 Syzygy
-    Added length validation for the 0xBD (client version) packet.
-
-07-01 Syzygy
-    ecompile looks for ecompile.cfg in the current directory before looking where the binary is.
-    ecompile now flags the following as errors:
-        var s := &quot;1234&quot; + ;
-        var a := +;
-        var a := { 4, +, 6 };
-
-06-30 Racalac
-    account.SetName() takes an optional second parameter for new account password. If you have RetainCleartextPasswords=0,
-        then you must pass a new account password, or you will get an error.
-    default WeatherType for a region is now 255 (no weather), not 0 (rain).
-
-06-30 Syzygy
-    Corrected a crash exception on character creation if a control character was included in the name.
-    Fixed a crash bug when displaying corpses in some circumstances.
-
-06-25 Syzygy
-    Items which specify &quot;SaveOnExit 0&quot; will have serials allocated from the same range as normal items.
-      This also fixes a bug where duplicate serials could be allocated for nonsaved items.
-
-06-24 Racalac
-    Changed MD5 hashing flags to work on a broader range of windows installations.
-    Instrinsic NPC weapons now are read-only for: hp, maxhp_mod, quality, dmg_mod.
-
-06-20 Syzygy
-    account.GetCharacter and account.DeleteCharacter will no longer accept an index of 0
-    Fixed a problem with character creation that could result in characters being written
-      with 'CharIdx -1' (these were all failed character creations)
-    Character creation will refuse to create a character with control characters in the name (newline, for example)
-
-06-19 Racalac
-    Added a 2 minute timeout for closing sockets POL has not received any data on. The client normally sends keep-alive
-        messages every 60 seconds. This may fix the &quot;number of connections reported much higher than the number of clients&quot;
-        bug.
-
-06-19 Syzygy
-    Fixed an access violation if a negative X or negative Y value was passed to various functions
-
-    canInsert / onInsert script rework, part 3: changing parameter order to make things more consistent:
-        adding an amount to existing stack:
-          canInsert( mob, container, movetype, INSERT_INCREASE_STACK, adding_item, existing_stack, amt_to_add )
-          onInsert( mob, container, movetype, INSERT_INCREASE_STACK, uninit, existing_stack, amt_to_add )
-          (NOTE: for canInsert, adding_item can be an uninit, if one of the CreateItem functions is merely adding to an existing stack.
-           By the time onInsert is called, adding_item is gone.)
-        adding new item:
-          canInsert( mob, container, movetype, INSERT_ADD_ITEM, adding_item )
-          onInsert( mob, container, movetype, INSERT_ADD_ITEM, adding_item )
-
-    Fixed a race condition which could cause socket error 10038
-
-06-18 Syzygy
-    escript: array + array will return a concatenation of the arrays:
-           { 3,2,6 } + {6,4}  returns {3,2,6,6,4}
-    AddMenuItem will once again accept 0 as a valid objtype
-    TargetMultiPlacement will once again accept objtype values between 0x4000 and 0x4fff
-
-    **** A VERY SPECIAL NOTE ****
-       It would be best if you defined all your your objtypes in the range 0x5000 to 0xEFFF.
-       See notes under POL092-2000-12-11 for how to specify OldObjType in itemdesc.cfg to convert objtypes at load time.
-    *** END VERY SPECIAL NOTE ***
-
-06-16 Syzygy
-    Fixed typo in RESURRECT_FORCELOCATION flag
-    The main listen thread will no longer be started if ListenPort=0
-
-    All intrinsic weapons and storage area root items are now always marked inuse
-        - this way, DestroyItem, EquipItem, dragging etc won't work on these types of items
-        (this was a cause of the dreaded 'itr != wc.items.end()' assertion failures)
-
-    Fixed a memory leak in GetItemDescriptor()
-    Added sanity checking in GetItemDescriptor use in case you set descriptor.CProps to other than a dictionary,
-     or StackingIgnoresCProps to other than an array, to detect this rather than crash.
-
-    canInsert / onInsert script rework, part 2:
-      old:
-        can/onInsert( owner, container, item, movetype )
-        can/onInsert( owner, container, item, movetype, amtadded ) (sometimes)
-      new:
-        adding an amount to existing stack:
-          canInsert( mob, container, movetype, INSERT_INCREASE_STACK, existing_item, amt_to_add, adding_item )
-          onInsert( mob, container, movetype, INSERT_INCREASE_STACK, existing_item, amt_to_add )
-          (NOTE: adding_item can be an uninit, if one of the CreateItem functions is merely adding to an existing stack.
-           By the time onInsert is called, adding_item is gone.)
-        adding new item:
-          canInsert( mob, container, movetype, INSERT_ADD_ITEM, new_item )
-          onInsert( mob, container, movetype, INSERT_ADD_ITEM, new_item )
-
-      These are the times when canInsert / onInsert scripts are called:
-        Client drag/drop
-        vendor buy: when moving items to the player's backpack
-        vendor sell: when putting gold in the player's backpack
-        secure trade, when cancelling or confirming a trade
-        MoveItemToContainer
-        CreateItemInContainer
-        CreateItemInInventory
-        CreateItemInBackpack
-
-    Since I didn't actually test the backtrace-on-assertion functionality under Linux, it didn't work.
-      Now it does.
-
-    console.cfg is now reloadable (ReloadConfiguration, or SIGHUP)
-
-    Added file.em module:
-        ReadFile( filename ): read a text file
-            reads a text file
-            returns contents as an array of strings
-            removing newlines
-        WriteFile( filename, contents ): write a text file
-            contents is an array of strings.
-            appends newlines.
-            creates file if it does not exist.
-            renames existing file to filename.bak
-        AppendToFile( filename, morelines ): append to a text file
-            morelines: an array of strings
-            appends newlines.
-            creates file if it does not exist.
-        LogToFile( filename, textline ): append a single line to a text file
-            appends newlines.
-            creates file if it does not exist.
-        By default, no package has any file access rights.
-        config/fileaccess.cfg: reloadable config file, grants access.  Example:
-            FileAccess
-            {
-	            AllowRead 1
-	            AllowRemote 1
-	            Package testfileaccess
-	            Extension .cfg
-	            Extension .src

-
-            FileAccess
-            {

-	            AllowRemote 0
-	            Package testfileaccess
-	            Extension .txt

-
-            FileAccess
-            {
-	            AllowAppend 1

-    new pol.cfg option: AssertionFailureAction = abort/continue/shutdown/shutdown-nosave
-        abort: (like old behavior) aborts immediately, without saving data.
-        continue: allows execution to continue.
-        shutdown: attempts graceful shutdown
-        shutdown-nosave: attempts graceful shutdown, without saving data.
-
-        If the assertion occurred during execution of a script, either 'shutdown', 'shutdown-nosave', or 'continue'
-        will abort that script, displaying the script name and PC.
-
-    Added uo.em function: ListMultisInBox(x1,y1,z1, x2,y2,z2) lists multis that have at least one static within the volume specified.
-    Resurrect takes an optional parameter.  If you pass RESURRECT_FORCELOCATION, will not check for blocking objects.
-        Be sure you know what you're doing if you pass this flag.
-
-    Just a note: if you're using Listener entries in uoclient.cfg, you should set ListenPort=0 in pol.cfg
-
-    ecompile: uses ECOMPILE_CFG_PATH environment variable to find ecompile.cfg, if present.
-      (note that normally it tries to look where the executable is.  Some shells don't always pass this,
-       particularly if you're using batch files or shell scripts - try putting the full path to ecompile in your batch file)
-    Added a bewildering number of options to ecompile.cfg:
-        DisplayWarnings = 0/1               (same as -w flag)
-        CompileAspPages = 0/1               (same as -a flag)
-        OnlyCompileUpdatedScripts = 0/1     (same as -u flag)
-        GenerateDependencyInfo = 0/1        Generate .dep files whether or not updating
-        DisplayUpToDateScripts = 0/1        Display the &quot;xxx/script.ecl is up-to-date&quot; message, or not.
-        AutoCompileByDefault = 0/1          If set, and you don't pass any script names or -r or -A, will perform an auto compile.
-        UpdateOnlyOnAutoCompile = 0/1       If set, autocompile will only update modified scripts.
-        DisplaySummary = 0/1                Displays overall totals after compilation, unless compilation aborted due to a compile error.
-      These are the settings I like:
-        GenerateListing		    1
-        GenerateDebugInfo	    1
-        GenerateDebugTextInfo	1
-        DisplayWarnings         1
-        CompileAspPages         1
-        AutoCompileByDefault    1
-        UpdateOnlyOnAutoCompile 1
-        OnlyCompileUpdatedScripts   1
-        DisplaySummary          1
-        GenerateDependencyInfo  1
-        DisplayUpToDateScripts  0
-        This way, if I'm editing scripts, I just type 'ecompile' and it compiles everything that's
-        changed.  If I want to compile a particular file, I pass its .src name on the command line.

-    mob.backpack.container now returns a mobileref to the owner.
-    bugfix: buyprice was sometimes being incorrectly read as 2147483647, after being
-            gratuitously written as 4294967295.  This value is now detected and ignored.
-    Resurrect() will return an error if the mobile's location would be blocked if the mob were alive (ie by a door)
-    LOS to an object is no longer blocked by the parts of other objects that share the same space with it.
-        For example, this means:
-            If two chests sit at the same place, neither blocks LOS to the other.
-            If one chest is at Z=1, and the other at Z=2, LOS to the first can be blocked by the second, if looking from above.
-            If a ghost is standing in a closed doorway, you can still have LOS to it. (but note the change to Resurrect above)
-    Fixed: When sending mana level, sometimes the &quot;current value&quot; would be sent in place of the &quot;maximum value&quot;, making it look like the mob had 100% mana.
-    ondelete scripts are now passed an offline mobileref.
-    Minor overhaul for onInsert scripts:
-        MoveItemToContainer:
-             now calls onInsert script _after_ putting the item in the container.
-        CreateItemInContainer, CreateItemInInventory, CreateItemInBackpack:
-             now call the onInsert script _after_ putting the item in the container.
-             when adding to an existing stack, passes the &quot;amount added&quot; as noted in the POL092 changelog.
-               (it was passing the size of the existing stack)
-         !!
-           I have just noticed that when any of these adds to an existing stack, the canInsert
-           script is called with these parameters: canInsert( mobile, container, existing_stack_already_within_container, MOVETYPE_PLAYER )
-           This is no good.  More thought required.
-        When purchasing from a vendor:
-            onInsert called _after_ putting the item in the PC's backpack.

-06-12 Syzygy
-    escript changes:
-        Added (yet another) syntax for declaring initialized arrays:
-            var x := array { 4, 3, 2 };
-            this is more consistent with struct { x, y, z } initializer syntax.
-            array(8,3,2) looks too much like it's creating a multi-dimensional array, so I don't like it anymore.
-        Added syntax for declaring initialized dictionaries:
-            var x := dictionary { &quot;abx&quot; -&gt; 72, &quot;xyz&quot; -&gt; 32 }; // direct
-            var key := 5, value := &quot;x&quot;;
-            var x := dictionary { key -&gt; value };       // indirect
-            var x := dictionary { &quot;abc&quot;, &quot;cyz&quot; }; // values start as uninit
-            var pfx := &quot;X&quot;;
-            var v := 7;
-            var x := dictionary { pfx+&quot;abx&quot; -&gt; 72, pfx+&quot;xyz&quot; -&gt; 32+v }; // with expressions
-        These are the preferred forms for declarations (see how they match?)
-            var x := array;
-            var x := dictionary;
-            var x := array { 53, 76, 32 };
-            var x := struct { x, y, z };
-            var x := dictionary { &quot;ABC&quot; -&gt; 62 };
-
-        Expressions like these will now be flagged as errors by the compiler:
-            var x := { 2, 6, };
-            var x := array { 2, 6, };
-            var x := array( 2, 4, };
-            var x := struct { a, y, };
-            var x := 4 array;
-
-        bitwise operations are now optimizable:
-            int &amp; int
-            int | int
-            int ^ int
-            ~ int
-
-    ecompile changes:
-        new ecompile option: -C &lt;config file path&gt;
-        new ecompile option: -A
-            &quot;Auto compile&quot;, I guess - compiles scripts in your PolScriptRoot and all enabled packages under your PackageRoot directories.
-              (like -r, but knows where to go, using ecompile.cfg)
-
-        Fixed two memory leaks.  ecompile is now much more svelte when it runs, especially on directory trees.

-    structs will again allow the obj[ keyname ] syntax, but only for strings.
-      if you pass a number, your script will abort.  If you pass another kind of object,
-      an error will be returned.  This is meant to help you quickly find cases where a script
-      pretends that a struct is an array, which is not the case.
-    fixed a compiler bug where the following would compile:
-        var a, b, c;
-        a := b { c, b };
-    AppendConfigElem will either accept an array of arrays, as it does now,
-      or an array of struct { name, value }

-    linux: SIGUSR2 will now display a stack backtrace to console, and continue execution.
-    linux: properly set socket nonblocking options after accept()
-      (learned, first from intense googling, then ironically enough from 'man accept', that
-       linux can't be bothered to adhere to BSD norms in the &quot;BSD sockets&quot; interface, and
-       instead discards socket options on accept()'ed connections)
-       Note: there's a hole in the aux client interface obj.transmit() function, where it
-             can still block, but it shouldn't be a problem if you're just using it to feed
-             a local web server.

-06-10 Syzygy
-    It is once again possible to use mobrefs / itemrefs etc as keys to dictionaries.
-    structs are now totally different objects than dictionaries.  They can only contain named members,
-     and the [] operator no longer functions on them.
-     Also, struct names are now case-insensitive
-     For structs, you should use operations like this:
-       var a := struct { x, y, z };
-       a.x := 5;
-       var b := struct;
-       b.+g := 6;
-     For dictionaries, you should use operations like this:
-       var a := dictionary;
-       a[57] := 4;
-       a[&quot;XY&quot;] := &quot;Z&quot;;
-       a.erase( &quot;XY&quot; );

-    revised signal handling for linux.

-06-08 Syzygy
-    Added dirty flag to all mobiles/items.  This should be set when anything on the object changes, and cleared on world save.
-    Fixed a crash bug when a container previously send with SendOpenSpecialContainer was deleted.
-    Fixed a crash bug on shutdown having to do with the thread registry.
-    SaveWorldState() now returns a structure on success:
-        struct { CleanObjects, DirtyObjects, ElapsedMilliseconds };
-    internal change: The following will now return a true 'struct', rather than an array bastardized with element names:
-        (If you access these with obj.elemname you will have no trouble; if you use obj[1] etc you will have to make changes)
-        object methods/properties:
-            mobile.reportables
-            polcore().script_profiles
-            polcore().iostats
-            polcore().queued_iostats
-        uo.em:
-            TargetCoordinates
-            SelectMenuItem
-            GetPosition
-            GetMapInfo
-            GetStandingHeight
-        npc.em:
-            Position()
-        events (all):
-            speech events
-            unicode speech events
-            damaged events
-            engage events
-            disengage events
-            item-given events
-    dictionary object methods now explictly check that key objects are either an integer, a real, or a string.

-    Major Addition: You may now specify properties for an item during creation. Here are the mechanics:
-        polsys.em: GetItemDescriptor(objtype or name) returns a struct of all the itemdesc.cfg properties
-        for the specified objtype. You can use this to print the contents:
-            var ret := GetItemDescriptor(objtype);
-            foreach thing in ret
-                print(_thing_iter + &quot;: &quot; + thing);
-            endforeach
-        There are a couple special members. &quot;CProps&quot; is a dictionary of string-&gt;object pairs (object could be any
-          packable type). &quot;StackingIgnoresCProps&quot; is an array of strings. You may edit the values in this dict
-          but not all are assigned per-item (meaning it will do nothing). The item create functions accept this
-          dictionary in place of the objtype / objtypename parameter.
-	For example, to create a new item that will automatically stack with an existing stack with non-standard
-          color and cprops, it would look like:
-                var ret := GetItemDescriptor(objtype);
-                ret.Color := 0x10;
-                ret.CProps.insert(&quot;blah&quot;,&quot;1&quot;); //assuming the existing stack have this color and cprop
-                ret.StackingIgnoresCProps.append(&quot;blingbling&quot;);
-                var item := CreateItemInBackpack(who,ret,10);

-    Changed: pol.cfg EncryptPasswords to RetainCleartextPasswords (default 1). NOTE this is logically opposite
-        to the old EncryptPasswords option. We now ALWAYS MD5 hash passwords and ALWAYS store them. Make this
-        option 1 if you want to also retain normal passwords, 0 if you only want the hashed passwords stored.
-    Added: PasswordOnlyHash is written to accounts.txt. If the cleartext password is missing, it will be
-        empty until the account successfully logs in.
-    Added: account.PasswordHash (password only hashed), and account.UsernamePasswordHash (username + password
-        hashed). account here is an account script object, i.e. character.acct.
-    Added: accounts.txt reading info, X elements in Y ms.

-    The .NET build now uses STLport 4.5.3 instead of MS's crappy implementation.
-      It seems to be a bit faster now.
-      Some comparison sysload numbers, using Xandros' huge shard data:
-        .NET old: 100(33018), 100(16326), 100(62705), 100(64700), 100(66679), 100(67030), 100(67030), 93(53725), 5(0), idle
-        VC6 05-24: 98(33533), 100(18338), 25(1519), 0(0), idle
-        .NET now: 35(19292), 6(1), idle
-    win32: we now retrieve CPU time used from the OS.  This is reported as cputime, when sysload
-      is reported.  cputime is read once a minute, and the value displayed is the number of microseconds used.
-      So, if cpuload is 10,000,000 then 10 seconds of CPU time were used.
-      It doesn't look possible to get this on linux without considerable teeth-pulling.
-    pol.cfg: ListenPort is now optional.  If you don't set it, or set it to zero, it won't be used.
-    Added to polsys.em: SetSysTrayPopupText( text )

-    performance improvements:
-        ListMobilesNearLocation

-    escript: fixed a bug where the compiler could emit corrupt code if an IF statement was optimized away
-    equipment.quality is now stored as a double-precision float, so equality comparisons should work better now.
-    Added itemdesc.cfg flags.  These apply to everything, even your own backpack.
-        CanUseWhileFrozen = 0/1
-        CanUseWhileParalyzed = 0/1
-    Removed internal command: .t_setusescript
-    Renamed internal &quot;.props&quot; command to &quot;.t_props&quot;.  This script should replace it:

-        program dot_props( who )
-            var what := Target( who );
-            if (what)
-                var names := what.propnames();
-                if (names.size() != 0)
-                    foreach propname in names
-                        SendSysMessage( who, propname + &quot;: &quot; + what.getprop( propname ) );
-                    endforeach
-                else
-                    SendSysMessage( who, &quot;No properties.&quot; );

-05-31 Syzygy
-    Backed out the 05/26 SetRegionWeatherLevel change which was causing a stack overflow
-      (which then caused pol to exit without any message)
-    Corrected music, justice, and weather zone switch handling.  They were broken
-      (would do no processing if you moved either into or out of a location entirely outside the regions)
-      Note: set the weather type to 255 to turn weather off.
-
-05-29 Syzygy
-    Target() will return a proper multiref if a multi is targetted (usable with DestroyMulti etc)
-      This does not apply to floors, etc - only ship masts and so forth.
-    Any function taking an objtype as a parameter will return an error if the objtype is not defined.
-      Note that all objtypes in the 0x0000-0x3fff range are implicitly defined.
-      (previous behavior was to throw an exception reporting that the objtype defined no graphic)

-    New console command [threadstatus] will display thread status and checkpoints
-    Thread status is now available on win32 as well as linux.

-    Fixed: a crash when an NPC killed itself in its script
-    Masked: crashes at shutdown due to leftover objects.  The objects will be leaked rather than attempt destruction.
-      (if we can find out _why_ we have leftovers, we won't get these crashes at all - this crash in particular is a symptom)
-
-05-23 Syzygy
-    Fixed: NPC weapons will use the hitscript specified, not the wrestling hitscript
-    Fixed: Display issue (1.26.4 clients only) when dragging an item to a mob that is too far away.
-    Linux build: Added segfault handler - will dump a stack backtrace to stderr before aborting.
-      please forward these (they'll just be a set of numbers) to PCT, if you're running the latest linux build.
-    escript: added more convenient syntax for declaring structures:
-      var t := struct { a, b, c };                                  // basic
-      var t := struct { a := 4, b := &quot;hey&quot;, m := foo(bar(4)) };     // initialized
-      var t := struct { a := 4, b := struct { g,h,i }, c };         // with nested structures
-
-05-22 Syzygy
-    NPCs will be destroyed immediately when they die, rather than a little later.
-    It should now be impossible to &quot;kill&quot; an NPC twice, ending up with multiple corpses.
-       There may be cases where an NPC will be only partially killed.  We don't know why yet,
-       but there will now be log information to help us find out why.  If you find an NPC that can't be
-       killed, please check your logs for output containing: &quot;Abnormal end after checkpoint&quot; and post to PCT.
-    NPCs will use their intrinsic weapon templates again.  They were using human wrestling.
-    Log additions: character creation, deletion

-    Fixed a crash caused when a script accessed container.container on something in a mob's backpack.
-
-05-16 Syzygy
-    item.setcolor( color ) will return an error if the specified color is &gt; 0xFFF
-      (it will still mask off the high bits and use what's left, though)
-    Alt-Tab should no longer show a window called &quot;Dialog&quot; while POL is running.
-    Fixed an assertion failure on load if a mobile or container failed to create completely.
-
-05-15 Racalac
-    Added: MD5 hashing of passwords. accounts.txt &quot;Password&quot; property is automatically converted, and saved
-        back to &quot;PasswordHash&quot;. No passwords are stored in plaintext on disk or in memory anymore, so full
-        memory dumps should be safe from nosy people. MD5 strings cannot be reversed back to the original
-        plaintext password.
-
-05-15 Syzygy
-    HitScript will be read from itemdesc.cfg entries for weapons, and used.
-    OnHitScript will be read from itemdesc.cfg entries for armor, and used.
-    AttackMinRange and AttackMaxRange will be read from npcdesc.cfg
-    uoclient.cfg can now specify multiple ports to listen for clients on, and the encryption to use with each.
-      Here is an example:
-        Listener
-        {
-            Port 7011
-            Encryption ignition
-        }
-        Listener
-        {
-            Port 7012
-            Encryption 1.26.4
-        }
-      Note that the Port specified overrides the value from servers.cfg.
-
-
-05-13 Syzygy
-    Changing an item's graphic will also set its height accordingly.
-    There's now a little system tray icon that will let you stop POL.  Maybe later it'll let
-      you look at the console output or logs.  We're accepting fan art for the icon :-)
-      You'll need to uninstall and reinstall the service (pol -u, then pol -i) for the tray icon
-      to be able to appear.
-    start.log will now be written properly when POL is run as a service.
-
-05-11 Racalac
-    Changed: With the CreateItemInContainer/Backpack functions, a new stackable item will not be added to
-        an existing stack unless the existing item stack has color equal to its itemdesc.cfg color property
-        AND has equal CProps as its itemdesc.cfg entry (not counting locally and globally ignored cprops)
-
-05-11 Syzygy
-    process.kill() will immediately kill sleeping scripts, as well as scripts being debugged.
-      (previously, script process would not die until the script woke up, if it was sleeping.)
-    Mobiles will now break off an attack when an opponent changes from non-Innocent to Innocent.
-      (previously, this happened for PCs, but not for NPCs, particularly pets)
-
-05-10 Racalac
-    Fixed another 4.0.0e client hang issue.
-
-05-09 Syzygy
-    Undid my brain-dead repsys timer change which was causing lockups.
-
-05-08 Syzygy
-    POL can now run as a service:
-        1. Put the executable in your POL directory (as always...)
-        2. Run 'pol -i' to install.  'pol -u' will uninstall if needed.
-        3. Recommended: Use the service manager to change the login from 'LocalSystem' to some account.
-        4. Start the service
-
-05-07 Racalac
-    Added new pol.cfg option: &quot;MiniDumpType&quot;, determines the type of crash dump created. &quot;small&quot; is the
-        normal minidump (default), &quot;large&quot; is the full memory space for POL (creates large files, but much
-        more useful to the developers). Case-sensative.
-
-05-07 Syzygy
-    Corrected possible crash bug in repsys handling
-    Corrected repsys timeout logic (would sometimes timeout early, would sometimes never time out)
-    Corrected possible crash bug related to client reconnections and interactive scripts
-
-04-25 Racalac
-    Fixed: CreateItemCopyAtLocation now copies cprops correctly.
-    Fixed: Dead NPC taking damage somehow is now killed.
-    Added: servspecopt.cfg property: UOFeatureEnable, used in the last dword of the 0xA9 login packet.
-           Probably has no effect (and possibly ill effects) until client messages like 0xBF 0x13 are
-           handled.
-
-04-18 Racalac
-    Fixed: Generic Gump textentry should work again for ANSI characters.
-    Added: Linux console command support
-
-04-13 Racalac
-    Fixed: Input is rejected for SendTextEntryGump if the string contains a control character (newline, etc)
-    Fixed: Generic Gump 'textentry' will strip out any control characters from user input.
-
-04-10 Racalac
-    Fixed: Moving a character during logout no longer throws an exception (introduced 3/27)
-
-04-09 Racalac
-    Fixed: MoveBoatXY did mot move items on deck properly.
-
-04-06 Racalac
-    Change: Call Attribute Intrinsic Modification exported functions before Vital Maximum and Regen.
-    Note: clients 4.0.0e and newer do not like the uoclient.cfg setting EnableControlFlowPackets enabled,
-        and causes login to fail. No way around this it seems.
-
-03-27 Racalac
-    Added: boat.em: MoveBoatXY(boatref,x,y)
-    Fixed: MoveCharacterToLocation with an offline character could cause an exception.
-    Fixed: who.multi was not returning a boat ref, when appropriate.
-
-03-25 Racalac
-    Fixed: 4.0.0e login issue (login tested with 4.0.0e (uorice), 4.0.0c (uorice), 3.0.8q (uorice),
-           2.0.0b, and 1.26.4b. (2.0.0g still doesn't work, oh well..)
-
-03-24 Racalac
-    Fixed: Login (A9) packet was the wrong length (might fix 4.0.0e login issue)
-    Fixed: Maps didn't work with set/get_member()
-    Fixed: Multi.isa wasn't working
-
-03-20 Myrathi
-    Fixed: ECOMPILE will no longer compile files with .src/.hsr/.asp/.inc
-        *anywhere* in the filename. These extensions must now be at the *end*
-        of the filenames for them to be compiled! (fixes 'file.src.bak' bug)
-    Found: Undocumented ECOMPILE option: -ri [dir]
-        Same as '-r' except it recursively compiles .INC files! Useful for
-        testing that your include files compile!
-    Fixed: ECOMPILE options bug: -r [dir] / -ri [dir]
-        These options will no longer 'eat up' options that follow them on the
-        command line (&quot;-r -u&quot; would incorrectly 'eat' the &quot;-u&quot; option!). Such
-        an option would be equivalent to &quot;-r . -u&quot; (recurse current folder).
-
-	NOTE: If you need to compile files AS WELL AS recursing the current folder
-	      you MUST add the '.' (no quotes) so it doesn't treat the files as a
-	      folder (WRONG one would try to recurse the FOLDER 'myscript.src'!)
-
-	      This is WRONG:  ECOMPILE.EXE -u -r myscript.src
-	      This is RIGHT:  ECOMPILE.EXE -u -r . myscript.src   &lt;-- note the '.'
-
-03-19 Racalac
-    Changed the order of calling the Vital Maximum and Regenerate functions via RecalcVitals().
-        Order is: Maximum function, Regenerate function.
-    Important CFG change: Set Weapon 0xF020 to SaveOnExit 0. This will force the intrinsic NPC
-        wrestling weapon to a non-saved serial number.
-    Fixed 03-18 npctemplate oversight.
-
-03-19 Myrathi
-    Added: extra 'movetype' parameter to Can/OnInsert and Can/OnRemove scripts.
-        The values returned in this parameter are as follows (new constants in UO.EM)
-        - MOVETYPE_PLAYER     : physically moved (dragged) by a player
-        - MOVETYPE_COREMOVE   : moved by the core (eg, MoveItemToContainer().)
-        And in the *Insert scripts only...
-        - MOVETYPE_CORECREATE : created by core (eg, CreateItemInBackpack().)
-
-    Example:
-        use uo;
-        program caninsertscript(character, container, item, movetype)
-            if ( movetype != MOVETYPE_PLAYER )
-                // allow any movement/creation by core functions
-                return 1;
-            endif
-            // insertion by a player must be validated
-            // ...extra code here...
-        endprogram
-
-03-18 Racalac
-    Fixed: &quot;npctemplate&quot; was not initialized on start-up when the exported
-        vital functions were called.
-    Added: pol.cfg options:
-        ReportRunToCompletionScripts=0/1 (default=1)
-        ReportCriticalScripts=0/1 (default=1)
-        - Set to 0 to remove the &quot;Script X running...&quot; (RTC) and
-          &quot;Critical Script X has run for X instructions...&quot; console messages.
-
-03-16 Myrathi
-    Fixed RequestInputUC() input-validation issue (control-characters are now
-        correctly identified).
-        Returns:
-        - 0 (zero) if input is cancelled.
-        - a struct: 'uc_text' =&gt; Unicode Array, 'lang' =&gt; 3-char language code
-        - an error, when appropriate (see .errortext)
-
-03-16 Racalac
-    Added error message for thread exceptions, AUX service.
-    Fixed annoying garbled &quot;Listening for HTTP requests on port&quot; message.
-    Fixed up RequestInputUC().
-
-03-16 Myrathi
-    Added: UNICODE.EM function RequestInputUC(): works the same as UO.EM's
-        RequestInput() function except it takes 'unicode array' and 'language
-        code' parameters in place of the 'prompt' parameter. The 'item'
-        parameter is still simply a placeholder and a client cannot act upon
-        one of these functions if the other has already been called (you'll
-        get the &quot;Another script has an active prompt&quot; error).
-
-03-15 Racalac
-    Added uoclient.cfg property: MaxSkillID (&quot;General&quot; section,default 51 if not found). Use this depending on
-        what client versions connect to your server. Newer clients can handle more skill IDs and older clients
-        (which often crash being sent skillids above 48). You must have skills.cfg entires for each skillid up
-        to MaxSkillID.
-
-03-14 Racalac
-    Added ClientEncryptionVersion &quot;none&quot; and &quot;uorice&quot; to help newbies. These are identical to &quot;ignition&quot;.
-    Linux Build:
-        This is Rac's first linux build, and hopefully it's improved. Previously, linux builds were made
-        using STLport and NO compiler optimizations. This build was made with libstdc++ 5.0.2, glibc 2.3.2
-        (with linuxthreads 2.3.2), gcc 3.2.2, and kernel 2.4.20. Consider using the same version libs as these.
-        Also, optimizations are turned on in this build (they were turned off because of inexplicable segfaults.
-        Hopefully, new build lib versions help this).
-
-03-13 Racalac
-    Fixed linux &quot;.unload&quot; crash.
-    Fixed exception with Character serial 0x1.
-
-03-12 Myrathi
-    Fixed: RadToDeg() and DegToRad() in MATH.EM. They now work the right way around. :)
-
-03-10 Racalac
-    Save character and item serial counter to pol.txt.
-    Increased Maximum UO SkillID to 51 (skills.cfg requires an update).
-    Fixed 03-08 bug: new multis not found with SFOBS.
-
-03-08 Racalac
-    Implimented Serial Recycling:
-        When POL reaches the maximum serial for characters (0x3FFFFFFF) and items (0x7FFFFFFF), it will then
-        search from the minimum serial (1 for characters, 0x40000000 for items) for an unused serial to give.
-        Note, nothing is done about CProps which store serials referring to destroyed objects. Hopefully with
-        this system of reusing the &quot;oldest&quot; unused serial will avoid most of these problems.
-    Very Significant speed improvement for all SystemFindObjectBySerial calls (including internal ones)! Your
-        start-up times (with CheckIntegrity enabled) should be vasty improved.
-    Fixed build so minidumps should give more information.
-
-02-18 Racalac
-    Removed unecessary equip layer check (some items in client 4.0.0 were prevented from being equipped due to
-        a client bug).
-
-02-09 Racalac
-    Added: new servspecopt.cfg options: DefaultContainerMaxItems (default 125) and DefaultContainerMaxWeight
-        (default 250). These values will be used for containers that do not define &quot;MaxItems&quot; and &quot;MaxWeight&quot;
-        in their itemdesc.cfg entries.
-    Added: OS.EM function: is_critical(). Returns 1 if the calling script was set critical, else 0.
-    Fixed: client version string was being limited to 10 characters.
-
-02-09 Racalac
-    Changed: CheckIntegrity=1 in pol.cfg now also checks storage areas and offline character for duplicate serial
-	    items (This extends start up times).
-
-02-08 Syzygy
-    Sort-of fix for shards with data files with very high serial numbers:
-        if 0x4effffff &lt;= serial &lt;= 0x40000000, serial will be allocated as a normal serial
-        if 0x7fffffff &lt;= serial &lt;= 0x4f000000, serial will be allocated as a &quot;nonsaved&quot; serial.
-        The upper range for &quot;saved&quot; serials will not be raised at this time.
-
-02-04 Racalac
-    Changed: PushthroughHook array of obstructors now includes hidden mobiles.
-    Changed: renaming a stackable item a specific name will now prepend the amount to the single-click description.
-        i.e. rename 2 items 'sucky item', then stack will produce a desc of '2 sucky items'.
-    Fixed: character.height was being assigned an incorrect value on start, causing LOS problems.
-
-02-03 Racalac
-    Fixed: offline boat travelers were not being processed correctly on startup, leaving them behind on the water.
-    Added: POL now supports Minidumps on Windows. If you are running POL on Windows XP, you do not need to do
-        anything to enable this. Before Windows XP, you need a new &quot;dbghelp.dll&quot; with version 5.1 or greater in your
-        POL directory. I've uploaded a redistributable version on core-test, this will be available and/or included
-	in the final 095 core package.
-
-        What Minidumps do: When(/if!) POL crashes, you will no longer see the cryptic dump of registers and call
-        stack. Instead, POL will log and print on console that it has created a &quot;.dmp&quot; file in your POL directory.
-        This file is much much more useful to us for debugging a crash than the simple text dump as before. This
-        File should be sent to the developers along with the usual &quot;what I did to cause this crash&quot; information.
-
-        If you run Linux, everything should work as before.
-    Added: Newly created NPCs send and receive SYSEVENT_ENTERED_AREA events with the NPCs around them.
-    Fixed by Syz: While on a moving boat, mobile's names no longer flash, and it's much easier to talk on a moving
-        boat. Only annoyance is now mobiles show the walk animation while the boat moves (but don't move anywhere)
-
-02-02 Syzygy
-    Added minidump support
-
-02-01 Syzygy
-    CoreRequired in pkg.cfg can now be a full version string (ie &quot;POL095-2003-02-01&quot; )
-    (pkg)/uoclient.cfg can now contain a 'Protocol' element:
-        Protocol
-        {
-            #
-            # EnableFlowControlPackets: use the 0x33 (0x00 / 0x01) pause/restart packets.
-            # Though OSI seems to no longer send these packets, they seem to help with smoothness,
-            # particularly with boat movement.
-            EnableFlowControlPackets    1
-        }
-
-01-30 Racalac
-    Fixed: &quot;TrueObjtype&quot; was not read correctly on startup.
-    Fixed: coordinate bounds checking for CreateNPCFromTemplate and CreateMultiAtLocation (still be careful with
-        this latter one, if some part of the multi overlaps beyond the map edge, it will cause problems)
-    Fixed: unequiptest and equiptest are now automatically reloaded after an .unload or .unloadall
-
-01-28 Racalac
-    Fixed a crash with destroying items in core-called run-to-completion scripts (like OnInsert) introduced 01-26
-
-01-26 Syzygy
-    foreach will no longer iterate over error objects
-
-01-26 Racalac
-    Added better stacking control over CProps: You can now specify specific CProp names that will be ignored when
-        items are being stacked. There are two ways to do this:
-        -Template level: new Itemdesc.cfg property: StackingIgnoresCProps, a space-delimited list of case-sensative
-         cprop names to ignore only for stacking items of this objtype. i.e.:
-             StackingIgnoresCProps    propname1 propname2 etc.
-        -Global level: A new packagable config file stacking.cfg (can be in /config and/or any package) specifies
-         lists of CProp names that are ignored for all stacking items (duplicate names ignored). Structure:
-             Stacking
-             {
-                 IgnoreCprops  propname1 propname2 etc.
-             }
-    Fixed: movecost.cfg entries were being interpolated in the wrong order.
-    Changed: MoveItemToLocation now calls UnEquipTest and UnEquip Scripts if the item was equipped on a char.
-    Changed: OnRemove and OnInsert are now Run-To-Completion (i.e. CRITICAL) scripts.
-
-01-24 Syzygy
-    The compiler will now put correct function names in listfiles.
-
-01-22 Syzygy
-    Added ReadMillisecondClock() to polsys.em
-
-01-22 Racalac
-    Fixed moved some npc creation code around so now npc.npctemplate is initialized by the time the vital maximum
-        and regen rate exported functions are called. (so grabbing the HITS property from the npcdesc element is
-        successful)
-
-01-20 Racalac
-    Fixed resetting stealthsteps (broken 01-09)
-    Added control character stripping from sysbook text entry.
-
-01-18 Racalac
-    Removed 01-06 LOS combat initiation check.
-    Fixed weirdness with merchant sell window and the .buy/sellprice changes.
-    Removed hardcoded death sounds for human characters.
-
-01-15 Racalac
-    Fixed: Errors on startup from corrupt items shouldn't crash the server. Also, file name &amp; line numbers are
-        printed for ease of debugging.
-    Fixed: Buying stackable items from NPC merchants now call canInsert and onInsert for player's backpack.
-    Fixed: Setting .buyprice and .sellprice to 0 means the item's price is 0, not itemdesc default. (setting the
-        members to -1 will force them to default to itemdesc)
-    Fixed: Entered/Left regions weren't firing since 12-23.
-
-01-12 Syzygy
-    Fixed an assertion failure when assigning to a non-integer element of an array
-      test script: &quot;var a := {}; var b; a[b] := 3;&quot;
-
-01-12 Racalac
-    Fixed: Polsys::ReloadConfiguration() now really reloads npcdesc!
-    Fixed: item.multi should now return the correct MultiRef (items on tables and other 'blocked' locations
-        were not being processed correctly)
-    Removed hack fix for bug noted in 01-08 changes. Caused problem with boats.
-
-01-09 Racalac
-    Fixed: polcore().clear_script_profile_counters() shouldn't complain if you pass 0 parameters (the correct amount)
-    Fixed: PC Unhide generating ENTERED_AREA events shouldn't fire strange combat update functions anymore.
-
-01-08 Racalac
-    Hack fix for gold &quot;dropping through&quot; floors of multis. This would affect ant 0 height graphic.
-        **Please let me know if there are any weird effects with multis, LOS around/in/through multis,
-        **walking on multies, dropping items on multis, and so on!
-
-01-07 Syzygy
-    NPC Templates in packages will once again have &quot;:packagename:&quot; prepended to their template name
-      (npc.npctemplate, as well as what's written to npcs.txt)
-
-01-06 Racalac
-    Fixed: You now need line-of-sight to initiate combat.
-
-01-05 Racalac
-    Fixed: run_speed and use_adjustments weren't written to the save file.
-
-01-04 Racalac
-    Added: obj.set_member(membername, value) and obj.get_member(membername) to replace the removed &quot;.&quot; method.
-        This sets/gets a built-in member on the object which is named &quot;membername&quot;. Returns an error if the
-        member was not found on that object (i.e. &quot;dmg_mod&quot; on a backpack).
-
-01-03 Myrathi
-    Implimented new encryption routines as the basis for making future encryption updates
-    a LOT easier (and is the start of internal support for encryptions 2.0.3 upwards!)
-    NO NEW ENCRYPTIONS ARE WORKING AT THIS TIME.
-
-01-02 Racalac
-    Added character and account name to &quot;No handler for skill X&quot; message.
-
-(sometime in the past) Syzygy
-    Deleting an element from the datastore will mark the associated file as dirty.
-
-01-01 Syzygy
-    Windows 95 is no longer supported.  Minimum (MS) OS required: Win98/NT4
-    Added to polsys.em: ReloadConfiguration().  Loads npcdesc.cfg and pol.cfg
-    Linux: HUP signal will cause ReloadConfiguration to be called.
-
-01-01 Racalac
-    Fixed: for real: EnumerateItemsInContainer crash (with &quot;worn items container&quot; who.backpack.container)
-
-03-01-01 Myrathi
-    Added: DefaultDecayTime=# in SERVSPECOPT(.LOCAL).CFG (default = 10) - unit: minutes
-        NOTE: Only newly created or &quot;refreshed&quot; items will use any new setting! Existing
-              items and items which remain &quot;untouched&quot; will retain the old value.
-    Fixed: Picking up an item, failing to place it somewhere else and having the
-        action &quot;undone&quot; (by the core) will no longer reset the decay timer if the
-        &quot;time until decay&quot; is greater than the default interval.
-    Fixed: CreateItemCopyAtLocation() now copies itemref.graphic to cloned item.
-
-12-29 Syzygy
-    accounts.txt will no longer be reloaded after a new version is written by pol itself
-    Failure to bind the listening socket will now cause startup to fail on windows.
-    New ecompile.cfg options:
-        GenerateListing [0,1]
-        GenerateDebugInfo [0,1]
-        GenerateDebugTextInfo [0,1]
-    Fix for ecompile under win32: use GetModuleFileName instead of argv[0] to determine
-      path to ecompile.cfg
-
-12-29 Myrathi
-    Fixed: Shutdown no longer crashes when built with .NET (bonus points go to Syz!)
-    Fixed: Deprecation warnings now give filename of the operator/token as well as line number.
-
-12-28 Racalac
-    Added: IP &amp; Account logging information for unexpected and out-of-sequence messages.
-
-12-28 Syzygy
-    Fixed a crash bug on exit in the VS.NET build (having to do with Token destruction)
-       (on the VS.NET build, some globals are destroyed in the opposite order.  We now manually clear
-        one particular container)
-
-12-27 Racalac
-    ReFixed: Players cannot rename a mobile with an invalid string.
-    MaybeFixed: Crash in EnumerateItemsInContainer. A long-shot fix, please test who ever was
-        experiencing this bug!
-
-12-25 Myrathi
-    Added: CFGFILE.EM function ListConfigElemProps(element): returns an array of the

-    Fixed: unicode support problems under Linux (think I got 'em all)
-    Fixed: various bugs in various unicode routines. :P
-    Fixed: unicode spell invocation using: ~IN&lt;spellid&gt;
-    Added: &quot;INVOKE: &lt;info&gt;&quot; console spam now restricted to [pol.cfg]LogLevel=6 or higher.

-    Fixed: Stat messages should now normalize properly to 1000 max-hp (0x11 packet)

-    Fixed: Exception if no regions were defined.
-    Fixed: CreateMultiAtLocation now returns a MultiRef, not an ItemRef ;)

-12-22 Racalac
-    Fixed: When combining two stacks of the same objtype (either dragging one stack onto the other, or
-        onto the container containing the other stack), the CProp lists of each item must match EXACTLY
-        in order to be stacked. So, if Stack A has cprop myprop i5 and Stack B has cprop myprop i6, they
-        will not be stackable by dragging. Similarly, if either of the stacks are missing a cprop the
-        other possesses, the items will not stack.
-        **Needs testing please**

-    Fixed: when a player buys an item from a merchant NPC, canInsert and OnInsert scripts are called
-        for his/her backpack.
-    CRITICAL: You MUST add this to an itemdesc.cfg entry or you server will fail to start!
-        Container 0xFF02
-        {
-            Name        WornItemsContainer

-            MaxItems    65535
-            Maxweight   65535
-        }
-        Note the objtype is in the core-reserved range of 0xF000 - 0xFFFF. I hope no one has any
-            items defined in that range.. :)
-        Note this change just fixed a bug with backpack weight limits, and won't help &quot;total&quot;
-            character weight (including equipped items).
-    Fixed: using an item's x,y,z members in its own create script would throw an exception.
-    Added: UO.EM function CreateItemCopyAtLocation(x, y, z, itemref): makes a clone of the item
-        referenced with &quot;itemref&quot; at location x,y,z. Copies member variables and CProps. Does
-        not work with Multi objects. Does not copy a container's contents.
-        **Needs testing please**
-    Fixed: Items split from a stack retain the CProps from the original stack.
-    Fixed: character.setwarmode() now works with NPC characters (no longer throws an exception)
-    Fixed: If the items sold TO an NPC merchant cost more than 60k gold, the core now creates seperate
-        stacks of 60k gold instead of one greater than 60k (invalid for the client). So if you have any
-        script code that handles this, you should probably remove it (or face creating twice the amount
-        of gold you should!).
-    Added: Unhiding AND Unconcealing generates a SYSEVENT_ENTEREDAREA event for nearby NPCs.

-    Fixed: A Mobile's lifebar will no longer disappear when you (for example), poison it.
-    Fixed: An exploit that allowed players to drag items onto far away mobiles.
-
-12-19 Racalac
-    Fixed: a bug with system books where bad characters were written to the save files, causing errors
-        like &quot;Item has no SERIAL property&quot;.
-    Fixed: If zero items were sold to an NPC, a gold coin was created in the player's pack with
-        amount == 0.
-
-12-17 Racalac
-    Fixed: a nasty bug where items would not decay in certain areas (specifically, in a zone with
-        a multi house). Also fixes the related &quot;items don't decay near multis&quot; bug.
-    Fixed: If an item is defined as no decay on multis (the default), its destroy script was
-        mistakenly called when the item was not decayed. This is fixed.
-
-12-15 Syzygy
-    Correct crash bug in CanRemove and OnRemove script execution when there's no owning mobile
-    The originally defining package will be listed when multiple packages define an objtype
-    &quot;attack timer&quot; spam outputs only when DebugLevel &gt;= 20
-    item.invisible will initialize based on itemdesc.cfg settings
-
-12-10 Myrathi
-    Added array.exists( index ) - returns 1 if index &lt;= array.size(), otherwise 0.
-    Added: sturdier parameter checking for object member-functions (no AV when too few params)
-    Fixed: corrected the size of the 0xBB 'messenger' packet (no longer &quot;eats up&quot; extra bytes)
-    Fixed: rename packet validation. Invalid content is truncated and a log message shown
-        for admin use (including an output dump of the invalid data).
-        Valid characters are spaces and upper- or lower-case letters (A-Z)
-        e.g.
-            Client #1 (account test) attempted an invalid rename (packet 0x75):
-            0000: 48 61 63 6b 54 65 73 74  0d 0a 09 43 6f 6c 6f 72   HackTest ...Color
-            0010: 20 30 78 34 38 30 0d 0a                             0x480.. ........
-
-    Fixed: core now sends correct number-of-chars to client at login (this should fix the UOTD
-        &quot;can't create character&quot; client issues)
-    Fixed: array member-functions (.erase(), .size(), etc) now enforce parameter-passing:
-        if you pass the wrong number of parameters (too few -or- too many) they'll return an
-        appropriate error (until now, passing too few caused an Access Violation! Argh!!!)
-    Fixed: arrays will no longer &quot;resize&quot; when you attempt to *retrieve* a value from an index
-        that doesn't exist. Setting a value in a non-existant index still resizes, as always.
-        Test array.size() or check array.exists(index) as appropriate.
-    - Example:
-          var arr := {1,2};          // create array with arr[1] and arr[2]
-          arr[4] := &quot;test&quot;;          // auto-enlarges to 4 indices (arr[3] is uninitialized)
-          var foo := arr[23];        // arr.size() is still 4 and it returns:
-                                     //    error{ errortext = &quot;Array index out of bounds&quot; }
-          var bar := arr.exists(15); // bar holds 0 since arr[15] doesn't exist.
-          var zim := arr.exists(3);  // zim holds 1. arr[3] exists, even though it's uninit!
-
-    Removed: account.SetAcctName() member-function (deprecated since 089!)
-        - use instead: account.SetName(name)
-
-12-09 Myrathi
-    Added new uo.em function: SendQuestArrow(to_whom, x := -1, y := -1)
-    - 'to_whom' is the character the arrow shows to.
-    - Passing 'x' and 'y' within map bounds will set the Quest Arrow to point at that location.
-    - Passing -1 as 'x' and 'y' (ie. by just called SendQuestArrow(to_whom)) will remove it.
-
-12-09 Myrathi
-    Fixed: All UNICODE.EM commands now take arrays with integers the &quot;right way round&quot; (sorry!)
-        Integers must now be &quot;Big Endian&quot; (0x1234) and not &quot;Little Endian&quot; (0x3412).
-    Fixed: Text-commands typed by a unicode-enabled client are now &quot;recognised&quot; properly.
-
-    Added: Text-command scripts now receive 2 extra parameters when activated by
-        Unicode-enabled clients.
-    - Program blocks should now look like this, to take advantage of them:
-
-            program textcmd_mycmd( who, text, uc_text, langcode )
-
-    - 'uc_text' is a &quot;Unicode array&quot; of 2-byte &quot;Big Endian&quot; integers (see above) and
-                can be an empty array (uc_text.size() == 0).
-    - 'langcode' is a 3-character, uppercase language code.
-    - 'uc_text' will be an 'error' type if the Unicode input is &quot;bad&quot;.
-    - 'uc_text' and 'langcode' will be uninitialized if no Unicode text is available
-                (ie, when a non-Unicode client types the command)
-
-    -Note- Text-commands should still be in an &quot;English readable&quot; character set!!
-           There is no guarantee that foreign character sets in script-names will work,
-           never mind Unicode character-sets, as the 'filename' is still matched against
-           the ASCII equivalent!
-
-    Added: NPCs now receive 2 *extra* event-parameters when they &quot;hear&quot; Unicode speech:
-    - 'uc_text' is a &quot;Unicode array&quot; of 2-byte &quot;Big Endian&quot; integers (as above)
-    - 'langcode' is a 3-character, uppercase language code.
-    - these 2 parameters do not exist when speech is received from a non-Unicode client.
-    - Example:
-
-        var ev := os::wait_for_event(120);
-        if ( ev )
-          case ( ev.type )
-            SYSEVENT_SPEECH:
-                PrintTextAbovePrivate(Self(), &quot;You said...&quot;, ev.source);
-                if ( ev.uc_text )
-                    PrintTextAbovePrivateUC(Self(), ev.uc_text, ev.langcode, ev.source);
-                    PrintTextAbovePrivate(Self(), &quot;...in Unicode&quot;, ev.source);
-                else
-                    PrintTextAbovePrivate(Self(), ev.text, ev.source);
-                    PrintTextAbovePrivate(Self(), &quot;...in ASCII&quot;, ev.source);
-                endif
-          endcase
-        endif

-    Fixed a crash bug with cheaters sending an invalid packet.

-12-04 Racalac
-    Added Character Method: setwarmode( 0/1 ); Sets the internal warmode flag and sends the
-        update to the player. Returns the new warmode value.
-    Added: MoveItemToContainer and MoveItemToLocation both call the item's parent container's
-        canRemove and onRemove scripts.
-    Fixed: Text command scripts now have their controller properly set. (character reference in
-        canInsert scripts where being passed as uninitialzed when the script was started via a
-        textcommand)
-
-12-02 Racalac
-    Fixed: Characters with the &quot;freemove&quot; privilages can now move with 0 stamina, frozen,
-        or paralyzed.
-    Added: &quot;You are too fatigued to move&quot; message when trying to move with 0 stamina, or
-        not enough stamina as defined in movecost.cfg. (Only if MovementUsesStamina=1 is
-        enabled in servspecopt.cfg)
-    Changed: MaximumClients in pol.cfg will be checked only after a character is selected to
-        play. Clients connected are only counted if they have attached characters (so a client
-        waiting to log in is not counted, and neither is a client that recently logged out).
-    Added: MaximumClientsBypassCmdLevel (default 1). This integer value (from 0 (player
-        cmdlevel) to 5 (&quot;test&quot;) defines the minimum character command level to bypass the
-        maximum clients check. So if the option =1, counselors and above staff can log in if
-        the MaximumClients value is reached, but additional player cmdlevel characters cannot.
-
-12-01 Racalac
-    Improvements to pol.cfg MaximumClients: cmd_level&gt;0 is checked, and clients without
-        characters attached are not counted against the maximum.

-12-01 Myrathi
-    Fixed: Unicode ghost speech (no longer shows in chinese)
-    Fixed: Various buffer overflow exploits in various uo.em functions (eg PrintTextAbove())
-
-    New EModule: UNICODE.EM containing 2 new constants and 4 new functions.
-
-        _DEFAULT_UCFONT, _DEFAULT_UCCOLOR
-        BroadcastUC(), PrintTextAboveUC(), PrintTextAbovePrivateUC(), SendSysMessageUC()
-
-    - These functions act identically to their UO.EM predecessors except for the parameters.
-    - ** please note the &quot;UC&quot; function suffixes **
-    - Unicode &quot;strings&quot; are actually EScript Arrays of 2-byte integers, where each integer
-      is a unicode wide-character. (example uctest.src will be uploaded to CoreTest group)
-      These &quot;integer codes&quot; are always clipped (internally) to 2 bytes (value &amp; 0xFFFF) and
-      a '0x0000' value will stop the end the string, regardless of the size of the array.
-    - Passing a non-array variable or an array with a non-integer value in it, as the
-      'uc_text' parameter, will throw an error. They MUST all be integers.
-    - The 'uc_text' array cannot exceed the current 'maximum speech length' of 200.
-    - LangCode's are 3-character identifiers for the language it's in: ENG, RUS, KOR, etc.
-      Passing a langcode string that's not 3 characters will throw an error.
-
-11-30 Myrathi
-    ECompile now displays &quot;deprecation&quot; warnings for certain operators and tokens and
-        although your scripts will still compile, these are now &quot;last warnings&quot;:
-        - '=' is deprecated; use '=='
-        - 'local', 'global' and 'dim' are deprecated; use 'var'
-        - 'begin' and 'end' are deprecated.
-
-        ** Deprecated expressions will be removed from 096 **
-        **     so make sure you update your scripts!!!     **

-    Improved: canInsert script will be called when a stack of item is placed into the
-        backpack through the paperdoll icon
-    Fixed: .hp, .maxhp_mod, for weapon and armor items should be writable again.
-    Fixed: .buyprice and .sellprice were returning 0 if you didn't write to them first.
-        Now if they are not written to first, they will return the itemdesc value for
-        VendorBuysFor and VendorSellsFor.
-
-11-27 Racalac
-    Added for Secure Trade Window: if a trade is cancelled, canInsert and onInsert scripts
-    will be called for the player's backpack. If the items cannot be inserted, they will fall
-    to the player's feet.

-    Fixed a bug with character.concealed being misread on server start as a boolean (0/1), not
-        an integer(0-255)
-    Fixed a bug in SystemFindObjectBySerial where items in the secure trade container were not
-        being found.
-    Fixed a crash introduced in the 11-21 test core concerning core-destroyed stacks of items.
-    Fixed a bug with the conceal system where if a character's concealed level was reduced to
-        a value still greater than 0, other characters of the same new concealed level did not
-        see the character.
-
-11-24 Racalac
-    Added new itemdesc.cfg property: UseRequiresLOS (defaults to 1 if not defined). If true,
-        Line-of-sight is needed to double-click the item. If false, a player can use the item
-        without LOS.
-        * Note DoubleClickRange is still checked.
-    Added new itemdesc.cfg property: GhostsCanUse (defaults to 0 if not defined). If true, dead
-        (ghost) characters may double-click this item.
-    Fixed a bug in SystemFindObjectBySerial where an item held on a character's cursor was not
-        found.
-    Added a new os.em function: set_event_queue_size(newsize) : Changes the maximum number of
-        events the current script will keep in the queue (additional events will be discarded).
-        If not called, the default size is 20 events. The function returns the old queue size.
-

-    active trades will be cancelled on death
-    Fixed a problem with listening points that would cause big problems after
-        listener destruction (house doors, tillermen, wink wink, nudge nudge)
-    Containers will default to limits: 150 items, 250 stones
-
-11-20 Racalac
-    Added a new object method: script_process.clear_event_queue(). (script_process comes from
-    NPC.process or uo.em's getprocess(pid))

-    You will no longer be able to initiate a secure trade with a ghost (if either party is dead).

-    These Item creation/movement/deletion functions now properly will update character's weight on
-        the status gump: ConsumeSubstance, DestroyItem, CreateItemInContainer, CreateItemInBackpack,
-        MoveItemToContainer, MoveItemToLocation, SubtractAmount.
-
-    CreateItemInContainer and -Backpack will call the container's canInsert and onInsert scripts.
-        POL will attempt to find a character that owns this container. If one is not found (i.e.
-        container is on the ground, the CharacterRef passed to the passed to the canInsert and
-        onInsert scripts will be an uninitialized object (so, check to make sure it's valid before
-        using it).
-
-    Adding to a stack of items (manually and by a CreateItem script function) in a container will
-        call the container's canInsert and onInsert scripts. Note if a script initiates this action
-        (and the script has no character controller), the CharacterRef passed to the canInsert and
-        onInsert scripts will be an uninitialized object (so, check to make sure it's valid before
-        using it).
-
-    The core will no longer play sounds effects for items being inserted into containers (thus, they
-        aren't heard by everyone.). You can get the desired effects using the container's onInsert
-        script. For example, to get the different gold drop sounds in addition to the default one,
-        you might have in your container's onInsert:
-
-        if(item.objtype == GetObjtypeByName(&quot;goldcoin&quot;))
-            if(item.amount &gt;= 100)
-                PlaySoundEffectPrivate( who, 0x38, who ); //lotsa gold
-            elseif(item.amount &gt;= 30)
-                PlaySoundEffectPrivate( who, 0x37, who ); //some gold
-            else
-                PlaySoundEffectPrivate( who, 0x36, who ); //a few coins
-            endif
-        else
-            PlaySoundEffectPrivate( who, 0x49, who ); //default sound
-        endif

-    Fixed Unicode speech (and a couple of possible buffer overflow bugs)
-        - Text commands are now properly recognised and run
-    TypeOf() (see basic.em) on Dictionary and Struct variables now returns
-        &quot;Dictionary&quot; and &quot;Struct&quot;, respectively.
-    Added &quot;unicode.em&quot; with Unicode support functions (refer to file for names)
-        - a Unicode &quot;string&quot; ('uc_text' param) is simply an Array of Integers.
-        - each Integer corresponds to a 2-byte Unicode character.
-        - each of the 4 functions must also be given a 3-character &quot;language code&quot;
-            - examples are &quot;ENU&quot; (US English), &quot;ENG&quot; (UK English), &quot;RUS&quot; (Russian)

-11-16 Racalac
-    New member for the Text Event struct: &quot;texttype&quot;. This will be a string with a value of &quot;yell&quot;,
-        &quot;whisper&quot;, &quot;emote&quot;, or &quot;default&quot; depending on the type of speech received.
-
-    NPCs will only receive text events if the source is in range, depending on the texttype (this
-        will be configurable in the future, for now, whisper is 2 tiles, normal is 12, and yell is
-        25 tiles). So an NPC will not get a yell event from a source 30 tiles away, even if its
-        speech event range is 40. Item text listeners will get all text in their range, regardless
-        of texttype. (Need feedback for this)
-
-    New os.em function: clear_event_queue(), empties current script's event queue.
-        (Distro folks! - need to add this prototype to os.em)
-
-    The npc.em movement functions (Wander(), Move(), WalkToward(), WalkAwayFrom(), RunToward(),
-        RunAwayFrom(), TurnToward(), TurnAwayFrom(), WalkTowardLocation(),WalkAwayFromLocation(),
-        RunTowardLocation(), RunAwayFromLocation(), TurnTowardLocation(), TurnAwayFromLocation())
-        now return 1 is the move was successful, and 0 if the move failed. NOTE this will almost
-        ALWAYS return 1, if UseAdjustments is true (see next item), because the &quot;adjusted&quot; move
-        probably succeeded.
-
-    New npcdesc.cfg member: UseAdjustments : If set to 1 all NPCs of this template will behave as
-        normal when blocked by and object (pace back and forth if path is blocked). If set to 0, the
-        NPC will not attempt to find a adjacent tile toward the target that is not blocked (defaults
-        to 1 if not found in the npcdesc.cfg entry). Also, a new NPC member with the name
-        &quot;.use_adjustments&quot; is read/write. These NPC changes are in preperation for a pathfinding
-        system.
-
-    New npcdesc.cfg member: RunSpeed . If present, (default to dexterity value) this value is used
-        for time delay between NPC moves (maximum usable value is 250, which is pretty damn fast!
-        Running NPCs move twice as fast as walking NPCs). Also, a new NPC member with the name
-        &quot;.run_speed&quot; is read/write. Note that this member may become a Vital in the near future
-        (before the 095 final release).

-    Fixed MoveItemToContainer bug (default container coords of -1 was being flagged
-        as out of range). Reminder: any value of x or y outside the gump coordinate
-        range as defined in the container's itemdesc.cfg will be interpreted as &quot;random location&quot;
-    Added new uo.em function: ListItemsNearLocationWithFlag(x,y,z,range,flags). &quot;flags&quot; here are
-        tiledata.mul flags for the item's graphic. A list of known flags is forthcoming
-        (curious people can see Alazane's file format page at

-    Fixed an additional MoveItemToContainer bug that was causing random location of items inside
-        the container gump.
-
-11-13 Myrathi
-    Updated ECOMPILE and RUNECL banners to include better version info
-        (number after the decimal point is the supported file version)
-
-11-12 Syzygy
-    Added support for ecompile.cfg and packaged includes
-        see scripts/ecompile.cfg.example
-        usage: include &quot;:pkgname:filebase&quot;;
-    npcdesc.cfg can once again hold non-&quot;NpcTemplate&quot; elements.
-    xlate.cfg is no longer loaded and ignored, just ignored.
-
-11-10 Syzygy
-    item.color := (value) will once again set the color properly.
-
-11-10 Myrathi
-    Updated item.facing - valid range is now 0-127
-    Updated TotalStatsAtCreation= option in SERVSPECOPT(.LOCAL).CFG
-        Can now take comma-delimited lists of values and/or ranges (default = &quot;65,80&quot;)
-        Example:
-               TotalStatsAtCreation=65,80,90-95,100-110
-    Anti-exploit checks in uo::SelectColor()
-          now validates values as 2 to 1001 to prevent client-side exploits:
-          - returns the chosen color value
-          - or an error (&quot;Client selected an out-of-range color&quot;)
-          An error situation will also display information on the console:
-          e.g.
-            Client #1 (account test) selected an out-of-range color 0x1
-
-    Anti-exploit checks &amp; updates in UNICODE-speech code
-          squelch()'d mobiles cannot speak.
-          Text-color is validated between 2 and 1001 to prevent client-side
-            exploits. Invalid color prints a message to console:
-            e.g.
-              Client #1 (account test) speaking with out-of-range color 0x1
-
-11-09 Syzygy
-    Major changes to the script engine:
-
-        ***   ALL SCRIPTS MUST BE RECOMPILED!!   ***
-
-        All scripts should function as they do now, with two exceptions:
-           .smember no longer works
-           the hidden iterator variable in &quot;foreach&quot; is now called
-                _(var)_iter instead of _(var)_counter
-        Fixed two major script object leaks.
-        Internal changes to the way member assignment and access works.
-        Internal changes to the way script substrings are handled.
-        Removed the 'Substring' object type.
-        Fixed: len() on an error would return random values
-           (now returns the number of elements in the error dictionary,
-            which is probably unnecessary)
-
-
-11-04 Syzygy
-    Fixed a nasty compiler error.  Expressions like this:
-        (!ev.source.isA(POLCLASS_NPC))
-        will now work properly.
-         The compiler used to consider that something like
-             (!ev.(&quot;source&quot;.isA(POLCLASS_NPC) ) )
-
-
-10-23 Syzygy
-    foreach now operates over dictionaries:
-        foreach v in dict
-            print( _v_iter + &quot; -&gt; &quot; + v );
-        endforeach
-
-10-17 Syzygy
-    xlate.cfg is no longer used.
-    spells.cfg no longer depends on xlate.cfg for reagent name lookup - will use itemdesc.cfg names.
-    Preload 'equiptest' and 'unequiptest' scripts, to speed system load time.
-       (however, equiptest/unequiptest scripts created after startup will not be noticed)
-    Changed config file handling to speed load time.
-       (menus.cfg entries might have their elements reordered, though)
-
-    Sped up system load
-
-10-13 Syzygy
-    Sped up storage area lookups
-
-09-14  merged changes from Racalac:
-    -New property for itemdesc.cfg Map{} entries: Editable, which defaults to 0
-        This determines if the user can plot points on the map gump. Note you can still edit the map
-        via the script methods.
-
-    -New script methods for map objects:
-        GetPins(): returns an array of structs with .x and .y members for each pin point.
-        InsertPin( index, x, y ): inserts a pin with the passed x,y before the passed index. Valid range 0 to n-1
-        AppendPin( x, y ): appends a pin to the end of the course with the passed x,y
-        ErasePin( index ): erases the pin at the passed index (valid 0 to n-1), and shifts pins down.
-        isa(): returns true if the object is a map object
-
-    -New pol.cfg option:
-        MaximumClients=X
-        Denies logon to clients if # of clients connected is at defined maximum
-
-    -New syshook for walking through other players, i.e. define a package with syshook.cfg :
-        SystemHookScript pushhook.ecl
-        {
-            Pushthrough Pushthrough
-        }
-        with pushhook.src with something like:
-
-        use uo;
-
-        program PushthroughHook()
-            return 1;
-        endprogram
-
-        exported function Pushthrough(walker, obstructors) //note passed ARRAY of mobiles in destination tile
-
-            foreach mob in obstructors
-                print(mob.name);
-            endforeach
-
-            if(GetVital(walker,&quot;Stamina&quot;) &lt; GetVitalMaximumValue(walker,&quot;Stamina&quot;))
-                return 0;
-            else
-                return ConsumeVital(walker,&quot;Stamina&quot;,1000);
-            endif
-
-        endfunction
-
-    -New player privilage: 'freemove' - ignore Pushthrough/stamina cost for movement
-    -New character method: character.GetGottenItem() returns itemref to item on player's &quot;cursor&quot;
-
-09-12
-    Linux changes
-
-=============================================================================
-POL095-2002-09-11
-=============================================================================
-    Changes for linux build:
-        Built with gcc 3.0, libstdc++2.10, on 2.4.18 kernel
-        Use sigaction() instead of signal() in hopes of correcting SIGPIPE problems.
-
-    The game clock will initialize before any objects are loaded from data files.
-    RecalcVitals will not operate on offline mobiles
-    Fixed an error related to multis which would cause decay to function sporadically
-      near multis, and to use memory without bound if items existed on multis.
-
-    Incorporated changes from Myrathi:
-        * Fixed IP Banning via /config/bannedips.cfg (no longer stops at first element)
-        * Warmode ghosts are no longer flagged criminal/aggressor for dbl-clicking on mobs/PCs
-
-        * Frozen/Paralyzed ghosts are no longer able to move due to being dead.
-
-        * HP/MaxHP update to nearby clients now uses a standard MaxHP ratio against 1000 hitpoints.
-          This should stop people from being able to snoop a mobile's exact HPs via a packet sniffer.
-
-        * item.facing can now be set from 0-101 (used to be 0-31)
-        * Added: AllowSecureTradingInWarMode=0|1 in SERVSPECOPT(.LOCAL).CFG (default = 0)
-        * Added: TotalStatsAtCreation=65|80 in SERVSPECOPT(.LOCAL).CFG (default = 65)
-
-        * Added: account.CheckPassword( password ) -- for validating an account's password
-          (returns 1 if the password is correct)
-
-        * Added: player.clientversion -- returns the client version string or an empty string
-          if the client has disconnected.
-
-        * BUGFIX!!! --&gt; find_supporting_multi()
-            static MultiList mvec;
-            vec.clear();
-            mvec.clear();
-
-        * Addition of packet structures (to stop incorrectly variant blocks skewing data):
-          - 0x15 0x1E 0x1F 0x23 0x26 0x28-0x2B 0x2D 0x2F-0x32 0x35-0x39 0x3D-0x4D 0x50-0x52
-          - 0x55 0x57-0x5C 0x5E-0x64
-          - 0xC8
-
-        * Update of packet structure information (just cuz):
-          - 0x53
-          - 0x65 (weather enumerates)
-
-        * Version string update
-
-        * Copyright date update (1993-2002)
-
-        + Fixed legacy v1.xx-client 0x33 pause/restart packet padding.
-          Still works for &quot;mass item/multi update&quot; though, to help with blackholing.
-
-        + Fast-walk client-checking (packet 0xBF) -- stack-cycle &amp; add-key
-        + Cursor Hues (packet 0xBF) -- Felucca &amp; Trammel
-
-        + Sound effect support updated: repeat/single-use, volume and 'z' variables noted.
-
-=============================================================================
-POL094-2001-07-25
-=============================================================================
-
-    Fixed an error where some packets would be sent to all connected clients,
-      no matter how far away the item was from the logged-in character
-
-    Element types for maps need to be changed from Item to Map - their objtypes
-      no longer have to fall within the range of 0x14EB toi 0x14EE
-
-    Added ConsumeVital( mobile, vitalname, hundredths ) to uo.em
-
-    Added GetAttributeIntrinsicMod declaration to uo.em
-    Attribute updates will be sent to the client
-    Life updates will be sent to nearby clients
-    Added mobile.attached:
-       returns process reference if a script is attached,
-       or an error (&quot;No script attached.&quot;)
-    If the Attack system hook returns false, core will handle combat as normal.
-    Vital regen rates will be limited to the range (-30,000 to +30,000)
-    Vital maximum values (in hunredths) will be limited to the range (100 to 10,000,000)
-       (1.00 to 100,000.00)
-    SetVital will accept any value between 0 and 10,000,000
-    Added SystemHook function Attack(attacker,defender)
-      -- called when the attack timer times out.
-      -- attacker must not be hidden
-      -- defender is chosen by checking attacker's Opponent, then Hostiles, for one
-         that meets the following criteria:
-           1) Defender is alive
-           2) Defender is in range of attacker's weapon
-           3) Defender is not hidden
-           4) Defender is not concealed from Attacker
-           5) Line-of-sight exists between Attacker and Defender
-    LOS will be checked when searching for an attackable mobile
-    Removed SetAttributeIntrinsicMod
-    GetIntrinsicModFunction added to attributes.cfg
-    added AlterAttributeTemporaryMod
-    Updated vitals will be sent to the client
-     - this only works for your own character, you won't see changes to others' vitals
-    Added GetAttributeIntrinsicMod and SetAttributeIntrinsicMod
-    Removed SetVitalRegenRate since regen rates are specified by exported functions
-    Added RecalcVitals(chr) which will recalculate regen rates and maximum values
-      for all vitals on a mobile
-    Corrected an error in the compiler having to do with optimization of if..elseif..endif statements
-    Newly created NPCs will regenerate vitals and start with maximum vitals
-    npcdesc.cfg entries can specify AttackAttribute instead of AttackSkillID
-    removed mobile.hp_regen_rate
-    removed mobile.mana_regen_rate
-    removed mobile.stamina_regen_rate
-    resmoved mobile.strength_mod
-    removed mobile.intelligence_mod
-    removed mobile.dexterity_mod
-    removed mobile.hp, mobile.maxhp
-    removed mobile.mana, mobile.maxmana
-    removed mobile.stamina, mobile.maxstamina
-    removed mobile.strength
-    removed mobile.dexterity
-    removed mobile.intelligence
-    removed uo::GetStatus
-    removed uo::GetStats
-    removed mobile.setstr()
-    removed mobile.setint()
-    removed mobile.setdex()
-    removed uo::GetRawSkill
-    removed uo::SetRawSkill
-    removed uo::GetSkill
-    removed uo::AwardRawPoints
-    removed internal attribute advancement due to combat (including parrying)
-    Added system hook: ParryAdvancement( attacker, weapon, defender, shield )
-    Weapon entries in itemdesc.cfg must have an 'Attribute' instead of a 'SkillID'
-    data/pol.txt needs the following element: (core 93 doesn't create)
-        System
-        {
-            CoreVersion 93
-        }
-
-
-=============================================================================
-POL093-2001-02-10
-=============================================================================
-    SetAttributeBaseValue will only accept base values between 0 and 2200 (0.0 to 220.0)
-    Added GetVitalMaximumValue(character, vitalname);
-
-    Added functions for Vitals:
-        GetVital(character, vitalname)
-        SetVital(character, vitalname, value);
-        GetVitalRegenRate( character, vitalname )
-        SetVitalRegenRate( character, vitalname, rate )
-        Regen rates are in &quot;hundredths of points per minute.&quot;
-        A current regen rate of 100 (1 point per 5 seconds) would therefore
-        be 1200 (12 points per minute) under the new system.
-        Valid Vitals are Life, Stamina, and Mana
-
-
-    Added 'CombatAdvancement' system hook
-      function CombatAdvancement( attacker, weapon, defender )
-      The builtin functionality performs the following:
-        For the Attacker:
-           Award 30 raw skill points in the weapon skill
-           Award stat gain as if the weapon skill were used successfully.
-           Award 15 raw skill points in Tactics
-           Award stat gain as if Tactics were used successfully.
-        For the Defender:
-           Award 15 raw skill points in Tactics
-           Award stat gain as if Tactics were used successfully.
-      This is called whether or not the attack was successful
-
-      (I'm sure I'm not the only one that thinks combat needs an overhaul)
-
-
-
-    Started the new Attribute System (Read this!)
-    ---------------------------------------------
-        The short story: these functions presently operate on the current
-          skills and stats that you know and love.  Core 93 will not change
-          the underlying skills and stats - GetSkill, SetRawSkill etc will
-          continue to work.  Core 94 will no longer support these functions,
-          so you have until then to convert your current usage to use these
-          new functions.
-          When this is complete, there'll be no more &quot;Raw&quot; skill/stat values,
-          and all Attribute advancement will be handled by scripts.
-
-        See core-docs.txt for a description of Attributes and how they work.
-        In particular, the &quot;conversion notes&quot; at the end may be useful.
-
-        Added uo.em functions:
-            GetAttribute( character, attrname );
-            GetAttributeBaseValue( character, attrname );
-            GetAttributeTemporaryMod( character, attrname );
-            SetAttributeBaseValue( character, attrname, basevalue );
-            SetAttributeTemporaryMod( character, attrname, tempmod );
-
-    config/pkgroots.cfg specifies additional root directories to search for packages.
-        An example pkgroots.cfg:
-            PackageRoot
-            {
-                dir d:\devpkg\
-            }
-        Do include the trailing slash.
-
-    Assertions:
-        Assertions are now present in the Win32 build as well as the Linux build.
-        EnableAssertions is now 1 by default.
-        DumpStackOnAssertionFailure=1 in pol.cfg will cause a stack backtrace
-        to be generated when any assertion fails.
-        In any case, an exception will be thrown on an assertion failure.
-        I recommend running with EnableAssertions=1.  It is reloaded when pol.cfg is changed.
-
-=============================================================================
-POL092-2000-12-11
-=============================================================================
-    pkg.cfg directive added: &quot;Replaces {pkg}&quot;.  Indicates this package should replace
-      any version of {pkg} found under the /pol/pkg/ tree.
-
-
-    objtypes.txt will be created on startup.  It lists all used and unused objtypes in numerical order.
-    Fixed a bug where only the first element in movecost.cfg would be read.
-    Added uo::SelectColor(chr,dyetub)
-    Removed internal dye and dyetub functionality.  (replacement 'dyeitems' package uploaded to pol-core-test)
-      - note this uses Zulu's 'dyecheck' script instead of the old internal functionality
-        to determine if you can dye a particular item.
-    Corrected a bug which caused BaseSkillToRawSkill (and therefore NPC creation) to take a
-      long time to complete (even for base skill values above 160)
-    Added support for the client's book interface:
-      uo::SendOpenBook(chr,book) kicks it off
-      The 'book' passed must have a Method Script, exporting the following functions:
-        exported function IsWritable(book) // returns 0 or 1 for readonly/writable
-        exported function GetNumLines(book) // returns maximum number of lines
-        exported function GetTitle(book)
-        exported function GetAuthor(book)
-        exported function GetLine(book, line) // line is 1-based
-      Writable books must provide the following functions:
-        exported function SetAuthor(book,author)
-        exported function SetTitle(book,title)
-        exported function SetLine(book,line,text)
-        exported function GetContents(book) // returns an array of all lines
-      I've put together a sample 'sysbook' package to demonstrate this.
-
-    Added the Data Store.
-      The Data Store is a collection of files, stored under data/ds/, saved
-        atomically with the rest of the world data.
-      Only those Data Files actually modified are saved at system save time.
-      A Data File is a collection of Data File Elements.  Data File Elements are
-        accessed by key, which can either be a String (case insensitive match)
-        or an Integer.
-      A Data Element is a collection of Properties.  Each Property has a Property
-        Name and a Property Value.  A Property Name is a string, and is, er,
-        case-sensitive (doh), while a Property Value can be any &quot;packable&quot; script
-        object.
-
-      In other words, a Data File is like a Config File that you can modify and
-        is stored under data/.  The Properties in a Data File Element are just 'cprops'
-        except that when saved in the data store I don't prefix them all with 'cprop'
-
-      scripts/datafile.em lists the functions that are complete and the methods provided
-        by a DataFile and by a DataFileElement.
-
-      Packages can have their own Data Files; these will be stored in
-        data/ds/{pkgname}/.  Normal package filename resolution rules apply.
-
-    Normal &quot;Open Spellbook&quot; handling will occur if the OpenSpellbook hook returns false.
-      (The OpenSpellbook hook script should return 1 if it handled the event, 0 if it didnt)
-    Any itemdesc entry can define zero or more 'OldObjtype' entries.  These are for
-      objtype renumbering.
-    Major rework of multi handling.  There must now be itemdesc.cfg entries for boats
-      and houses, and the objtypes aren't tied to the MultiIDs.  Multis.cfg defines what to
-      expect in multi.mul.
-      CreateMultiAtLocation has more flags for boat creation
-        (CRMULTI_FACING_NORTH, CRMULTI_FACING_EAST, etc)
-      An example entry for pkg/std/boat/itemdesc.cfg:
-        Boat 0x6041
-        {
-            Name smalldragonboat
-            Graphic 0x4004      // base graphic
-            MultiID 0x0004
-
-            OldObjtype 0x4004
-            OldObjtype 0x4005
-            OldObjtype 0x4006
-            OldObjtype 0x4007
-        }
-      An example entry for pkg/std/housing/itemdesc.cfg:
-        House 0x6060
-        {
-            Name smallstoneandplasterhouse
-            Graphic 0x4064
-            MultiID 0x64
-
-            OldObjtype 0x4064
-        }
-      See the latest pol-coresupp zip for config/multis.cfg
-
-
-    Fixed an error where the server would fail to start if a container was overfilled
-    RegisterForSpeechEvents takes an optional 'flags' parameter.  If LISTENPT_HEAR_GHOSTS is
-      passed, this listening point will hear unfiltered ghost speech.
-    Added scripts/include/sysevent.inc.  All system EVID_* constants have been copied here
-      and renamed to SYSEVENT_*.
-    Added SYSEVENT_GHOST_SPEECH (0x1000), to allow an NPC to hear unfiltered ghost speech.
-      The NPC must still be able to _see_ the ghost in able to hear it.
-    NPC event masks will now be checked for SYSEVENT_SPEECH being set.
-    Added npc.eventmask, in part to help you find scripts that don't set SYSEVENT_SPEECH.
-    Added npc.speech_color and npc.speech_font.  npc::say() will use these.
-      These will be saved in npcs.txt as SpeechColor and SpeechFont (and can be specified in
-      npcdesc.cfg)
-
-    Added uo::AddAmount(item,amount)
-      - only adds to stackables
-      - only allows stacks up to 60,000
-      - checks for container overfill
-    Added an optional 'flags' parameter to CreateMultiAtLocation
-      - uo.em contains constants to add together (CRMULTI_*)
-      - this parameter only applies to houses, not boats
-    Before character deletion, scripts/misc/ondelete.ecl and anypkg/ondelete.ecl will be called.
-      Their return values are ignored.
-    New system hook: OpenSpellbook( chr ), called when the Open Spellbook packet is received
-     (not when a spellbook is doubleclicked).  This is called even if the character is dead!
-
-    Added 'Method Scripts' for items:
-      An itemdesc.cfg entry can specify a 'MethodScript'
-      This is a script that (presumably) contains exported functions.
-      Method calls on the item are forwarded to the exported functions in this script.
-      Exported functions can have the same name as an existing object method.  In this case,
-        the exported function will override the existing object method.
-      An example that modifies door.open():
-
-      pkg/.../door/itemdesc.cfg:
-        Door 0x0675
-        {
-            xmod -1
-            ymod +1
-            script door
-            doortype metal
-            MethodScript cdoor.ecl
-        }
-
-      pkg/.../door/cdoor.src:
-        exported function open( door )
-            print( &quot;cdoor::open(&quot; + door.serial + &quot;)&quot; );
-            return door._open();
-        endfunction
-
-        program install()
-            print( &quot;installing cdoor&quot; );
-            return 1;
-        endprogram
-
-      Note the mostly empty 'program' section.  It must return 1 in order for the
-        method script to be installed.
-      Script methods don't have to be the same as existing methods, and can take
-        and number of parameters.  Pass-by-reference should be possible, as well.
-      Method scripts can only be specified for items in packages; the server will
-        probably blow chunks if you try it in pol/config/itemdesc.cfg.
-    Preceding a method call with an underscore will directly call the &quot;real&quot; object method.
-
-
-    escript changes:
-        'int' is no longer a reserved word
-        'exported' is now a reserved word
-    logon scripts in packages will now be called on character creation
-    Added the concept of a &quot;System Hook&quot;:
-      - Any package can contain a syshook.cfg file
-      - Each entry is a SystemHookScript, which can provide one or more exported functions
-      - the only function that can presently be hooked is 'CheckSkill'
-      - A sample syshook.cfg:
-            SystemHookScript hooktest.ecl
-            {
-                CheckSkill MyCheckSkill
-            }
-      - And hooktest.src to go with it:
-            use uo;
-
-            exported function MyCheckSkill(who,skillid,difficulty,points)
-                print( &quot;MyCheckSkill(&quot;+who.serial+&quot;,&quot;+skillid+&quot;,&quot;+difficulty+&quot;,&quot;+points+&quot;)&quot; );
-
-                // note you can call the &quot;system&quot; function normally
-                return CheckSkill(who,skillid,difficulty,points);
-            endfunction
-
-            program hooktest()
-                print( &quot;hooktest prog&quot; );
-            endprogram
-      - The 'program' section is executed once, at system startup.
-        Thereafter, the exported function is called as needed.
-      - A hooked 'CheckSkill' will override any script's call to CheckSkill, as
-        well as the internal combat CheckSkill calls.
-      - Each hooked function has a recursion guard, so the system function can
-        be called from within the hook function (as in the example above)
-      - there is currently no way to unload system hook functions
-
-    Containers won't count their own weight against the weight they can hold
-    Multiple scripts can have active gump dialogs on a particular client
-
-    The 'SecureTradeContainer' itemdesc.cfg entry must specify &quot;Weight 0&quot;
-    Here is the entry I use:
-        Container 0xFF01
-        {
-            Name    SecureTradeContainer
-            graphic 0x1E5E
-            Gump    0x003C
-            MinX    0
-            MaxX    66
-            MinY    0
-            MaxY    33
-            Weight  0
-        }
-    If &quot;Weight 0&quot; is not specified, mobiles who participate in secure trading
-      will weight 255 stones more than they should.
-
-
-    Container entries in itemdesc.cfg can specify MaxWeight and MaxItems
-      - if zero (or not specified) there are no limits
-      - if MaxItems is specified, it includes item counts for child containers
-      - if MaxWeight is specified, it includes weights for child containers
-      - there is still a limit of 150 items in the top-level of a container
-          (so as not to flip out the client)
-      - added item.item_count
-      - container count and weight limits will not be enforced during startup
-    Weight of a mobile will now include items being &quot;dragged&quot; as well as
-      items in the secure trade window
-    Added Container scripts (specify in itemdesc.cfg):
-        Entries:
-            CanInsertScript // called to see if an item can be inserted
-            OnInsertScript  // started after an item is inserted
-            CanRemoveScript // called to see if an item can be removed
-            OnRemoveScript  // started after an item is removed
-      - program definitions are:
-      - program can_insert( who, container, item );
-      - program on_insert( who, container, item );
-      - program on_insert( who, container, item, amtadded ); // if an existing stack was added to
-
-      - program can_remove( who, container, item ); // return nonzero to allow removal
-      - program on_remove( who, container, item ); // when the item is dragged
-            - note the item will always be &quot;in use&quot; when this script is called.
-      - only started on &quot;client drag&quot; operations
-    Packed variables containing 'x' characters (an empty array element) should unpack correctly
-      (would have unpacked a huge error object instead of a nothing)
-
-=============================================================================
-POL091-2000-11-01
-=============================================================================
-    Added more guild support:
-      All guild data is stored in data/guilds.txt.  Existing GuildId entries in
-      pcs.txt will be migrated.
-      Ally and Enemy status is always 2-way, and is not transitive, so any hierarchies
-        will have to be implemented in script.
-
-      - new uo.em functions:
-        CreateGuild();          // returns a guildref
-        FindGuild( guildid );   // returns a guildref or error
-        ListGuilds();           // returns an array of guildrefs
-        DestroyGuild( guild );   // destroys a guild with neither members, allies, nor enemies
-      - Guild Object
-        Properties:
-         guild.guildid : integer, unique guild identifier
-         guild.members : array of offline mobilerefs
-         guild.allyguilds  : array of allied guilds
-         guild.enemyguilds : array of enemy guilds
-
-        Methods:
-         guild.ismember( who )
-         guild.isallyguild( otherguild )
-         guild.isenemyguild( otherguild )
-
-         guild.addmember( who )
-         guild.addallyguild( otherguild )
-         guild.addenemyguild( otherguild )
-
-         guild.removemember( who )
-         guild.removeallyguild( otherguild )
-         guild.removeenemyguild( otherguild )
-
-         guild.getprop( propname )
-         guild.setprop( propname, propvalue )
-         guild.eraseprop( propname )
-
-    Added Auxilliary Client Interface
-      - a package can contain 'auxsvc.cfg'
-      - packed values are sent, newline-terminated.  These show up on the aux service
-        script's event queue as an event with ev.type = &quot;recv&quot; and ev.value = the unpacked value
-      - parameter to the aux control script is an AuxConnection
-      - AuxConnection.transmit( val ) sends packed representation of val, newline terminated.
-      - see 'pkgauxsvc.zip' for an example
-
-    &quot;CON&quot;, &quot;AUX&quot;, &quot;PRN&quot;, and &quot;NUL&quot; will be disallowed as text command names.
-    NPC intrinsic weapons will be re-equipped after unequipping another weapon
-      (instead of switching to the human wrestling weapon)
-    Removed &quot;Searching for&quot; messages when looking for textcmds
-    An &quot;Unknown command&quot; message will display if you mistype a textcmd
-    NPCs will walk through mobiles they can't see (whether due to concealment or hiding).
-    NPC AttackHitScript entries cause hit scripts to fire now.
-    Ghosts will no longer impede NPC movement.
-    minrange and maxrange can be specified in Weapon entries in itemdesc.cfg.
-      Default for melee weapons: minrange 0, maxrange 1
-      Default for projectile weapons: minrange 2, maxrange 20
-        (same as previous code)
-    NPCs in packages should retain their intrinsic weapon after a restart.
-    npc.isa(t) and mobile.isa(t) now work
-    mobile.setcriminal(0) now works
-    PID will display for runaway scripts
-    ReadConfigFile( &quot;:*:foo&quot; ) will load a combination of all foo.cfg files found in
-      config/ and all package directories.  These can be unloaded.  This method is preferred
-      over using &quot;::itemdesc&quot;, &quot;::spells&quot;, and &quot;::skills&quot;, since reloading will be handled
-      correctly.
-    Added extra checking on item destruction in case a destroyscript is evil
-    Added uo::SendViewContainer( chr, container ) - just sends the container contents
-      (does not grant access like SendOpenSpecialContainer)
-    mobile.truecolor and mobile.trueobjtype are r/w (though I think trueobjtype has no effect)
-    Fixed a crash bug in some instances of item destruction, decay being one example.
-    &quot;AttackHitScript&quot; can be specified in npcdesc.cfg entries for a per-npctemplate HitScript.
-        For packaged npcdesc.cfg entries, this will need to have the package specified.
-        Also note that AttackSpeed must be specified for any per-npctemplate Attack* properties to be used.
-    added object.isa( polclass_type ) : boolean
-      use constants POLCLASS_OBJECT, POLCLASS_ITEM, etc from uo.em
-        example:
-          door.isa( POLCLASS_DOOR ) will return true
-          door.isa( POLCLASS_ITEM ) will return true
-          door.isa( POLCLASS_MOBILE ) will return false
-    Whisper range is 2, Yell range is 25
-    Items in decaying locked containers will be destroyed with the container.
-    movable=0 items in decaying containers will be destroyed.
-      Note that in both cases, destroy scripts will not execute.
-       (Destroy scripts execute only when DestroyItem is called, or when a toplevel
-        item is checked for decay)
-    '=' is assumed to be a command prefix (as well as '.')
-    mob.setcriminal(0) will clear the criminal timer and send status update packets
-    &quot;destroy [desc] ...&quot; messages will no longer display on item destruction.
-
-POL090-2000-09-03
-=================
-SPECIAL NOTE:
-  ALL SCRIPTS MUST BE RECOMPILED!  (all your scripts compile, right? :-)
-  Old .ECL files will not load!
-
-Titles
-    - if present, &quot;[title_guild]&quot; will display above name on singleclick
-    - if present, &quot; (title_race)&quot; will display after name on paperdoll
-    - title_prefix, title_suffix, title_guild and title_race can contain leading
-         and trailing spaces, embedded quotes, and embedded newlines.
-
-Interactive Debugger
-    - Added beginning of debugger interface.
-         pol.cfg: DebugPort=port, DebugPassword=string, DebugLocalOnly=0/1
-         Only enabled if DebugPort if specified as non-zero.
-    - Added local variable information to .dbg files
-    - Added stepinto debug command
-         (see srcdoc/poldbg.txt for debug command list)
-    - Added debugger commands:
-         pidlist [str]             return list of PIDs with scriptnames matching *str*
-         inslist [file] [line]     list instructions associated with File#/Line#
-         globalvars                list global variable names (if available, compile
-                                    with -z)
-         getlocalpacked [N]        get local variable #N, in packed format
-         setlocalpacked [N] [p]    set local variable #N, to packed value
-         getglobalpacked [N]       get global variable #N, in packed format
-         setglobalpacked [N] [p]   set global variable #N, to packed value
-    - Added debugger command 'call'
-         call [scriptname] [parameters:packed array]
-         parameters must be a packed array.
-         return value is returned packed.
-         So, if 'misc/called.src' ends with 'return 5;' then;
-         &quot;call misc/called.ecl a3:i1i2i3&quot;
-         will call misc/called.src, with three parameters: 1, 2, 3
-         Output will be:
-           Results: 1
-           Return value packed: i5
-    - Added debugger command 'quit' - graceful exit.
-
-eScript
-    - Added 'runecl.exe' to the core distro.
-        - only has access to 'basic', 'basicio', and 'math' execution modules
-    - Added math.em execution module
-    - Added Integer modulus operator '%'
-    - Added bitwise operators, for Integers only
-       &amp; (bitwise and)
-       | (bitwise or)
-       ^ (bitwise xor)
-       ~ (one's complement)
-    - Added 'sysfind_flags' parameter to SystemFindObjectBySerial
-       - flag values can be found in uo.em:
-       - SYSFIND_SEARCH_OFFLINE_MOBILES - search for offline mobiles and equipment
-          on offline mobiles
-       - SYSFIND_SEARCH_STORAGE_AREAS   - search for items in all storage areas
-    - SystemFindObjectBySerial will always return an 'offline mobileref' if
-       SYSFIND_SEARCH_OFFLINE_MOBILES is specified.
-    - Added the 'struct' type.  These can be persisted, unlike a struct created
-      from an array.  Structs should be used rather than arrays when you want a
-      structure.
-      preferred forms:
-          var a,b,c,d;
-          a := array;      // make an empty array
-          a[1] := 2;
-          a[2] := 7;
-
-          b := struct;
-          b.+name := &quot;YouThere&quot;;
-          print( b.name );
-
-          c := dictionary;
-          c[&quot;hello&quot;] := &quot;foo&quot;;
-          c[&quot;world&quot;] := &quot;bar&quot;;
-
-          d := { 2, 5 };   // make an initialized array
-    - The 'error' datatype is now persistable (internally it's a 'struct')
-    - Added pids (process ids) and a scripting object for process control
-       - os::getpid() gets your own pid
-       - os::getprocess(pid) gets a scripting object for a process given its PID
-    - Added polcore().skill_checks_per_min
-    - Added polcore().combat_operations_per_min
-    - The instares dialog gump packet will no longer be sent automatically on PC death
-       - chrdeath.src will have to handle this
-    - Added uo::SendInstaResDialog( chr );
-    - Added AwardRawSkillPoints( mobile, skillid, rawpoints )
-       - rawpoints must be positive at this time
-    - &quot;pol.lg2&quot; has been renamed to &quot;debug.log&quot; and is enabled in
-        pol.cfg:EnableDebugLog=0/1
-    - Added process.sendevent( object );
-    - Added process.kill();
-    - start_script will now return a process scripting object
-    - Added npc.process, returns a process scripting object
-    - Global variable name information is now included in .dbg files
-       '-z' option removed - only '-x' generates .dbg files
-       .dbg.txt files no longer generated
-    - Added GetObjPropertyNames(object) - returns array of all cprop names
-    - Configfile string properties can be contained within quotes, and can contain
-       leading and trailing spaces, embedded quotes (\&quot;), and embedded newlines (\n)
-    - SendSysMessage, Broadcast, PrintTextAbove, and PrintTextAbove all take
-       optional parameters 'font' and 'color'
-    - Added item.buyprice
-       If nonzero, overrides the 'vendor_buys_for' value from itemdesc.cfg
-       If negative, vendors will not buy this item.
-    - 'invisible' in itemdesc.cfg will be honored as the default.
-
-Compiler
-    - Search rules for .inc and .em files changed:
-       - First, the directory of the including file is searched
-       - Next, either ECOMPILE_PATH_EM or ECOMPILE_PATH_INC (which default to
-          the directory containing ecompile.exe) are searched
-       - relative dir info from the included filename is always used.
-       - pass '-v10' to the compiler to see what's going on, if it can't find
-         your files.
-       - This means that:
-           D:\POL&gt; ecompile -r .
-           D:\POL\PKG\MYPKG&gt; ecompile foo.src
-           D:\POL\SCRIPTS&gt; ecompile ..\pkg\mypkg\foo.src
-          should all be equivalent now.
-       - If you intend to use the debugger, compiling from your pol\ directory
-           is best, (or specifying a full path) so that pol.exe will have the
-           correct paths to all involved files.
-       - I recommend &quot;ecompile -u -b -l -x -a -r d:\pol&quot;
-    - It seems those of you using Win2k and Linux will need to have
-       ECOMPILE_PATH_EM and ECOMPILE_PATH_INC variables.
-
-Reputation System
-    - See srcdoc/repsys.htm for current criminal/murderer flagging rules
-    - Added mobile.SetParalyzed( isparalyzed := 1 );
-       - mobile.paralyzed := 1/0 is deprecated and will become read-only
-       - mobile.SetPoisoned sets repsys data
-    - Added mobile.SetPoisoned( ispoisoned := 1 )
-       - mobile.poisoned := 1/0 is deprecated for this use (it will become read-only)
-       - mobile.SetPoisoned can set repsys data (aggressor, criminal flagging)
-        mobile.poisoned assignment cannot.
-       - mobile.SetPoisoned will no longer set the Murderer flag
-    - Added mobile.SetCriminal( level := 1 ), level &gt;= 1
-    - Added mobile.SetMurderer( ismurderer := 1 )
-    - Added mobile.murderer read-only flag
-    - mobile.criminal will always return true for murderers.
-    - Healing, Unpoisoning, and Unparalyzing will clear the ToBeReportable list if
-       all are clear
-    - A mobile's Reportables list is now persisted
-       Added mobile.reportables (see srcdoc/uoscrobj.htm for details)
-       Added mobile.RemoveReportable( serial, gameclock )
-    - &quot;.i_repdata&quot; updated to display murderer flag, ToBeReportable list, and
-       Reportable list
-    - repsys.cfg: added a General section, with Criminal and Aggressor timeouts.
-
-Client Issues
-    - Added Ignition support
-    - Weather packets are now disabled for all non-1.26.* clients (including Ignition)
-    - pol.cfg: DisplayUnknownPackets=0/1 added
-    - pol.cfg: ClientEncryptionVersion can be set to 1.26.4 , 2.0.0 , or ignition
-
-Errors Resolved
-    - Fixed a crash bug in SystemFindObjectBySerial when the object wasn't found
-    - Possibly fixed the &quot;skill window update&quot; client crash bug
-    - hair and beards created on corpses will be marked invisible and non-movable
-    - Ghosts will no longer be able to pick up or equip items.
-    - Dye tub cursors will no longer be sent if a script cursor is active
-    - Script constructs of the following form will no longer alter chr.name:
-       var n := chr.name;
-       n := &quot;hey&quot;;
-       - this applies to all other read/write members
-    - ECOMPILE_PATH_EM and ECOMPILE_PATH_INC env variables will no longer be necessary
-       - (See compiler section above)
-    - Corrected some problems with target cursors
-    - Corrupt .ECL files should be handled better now
-    - fixed a crash bug if global variables were used before declared
-
-Miscellaneous
-    - movecost.cfg can have separate 'Walking' and 'Running' sections, and can
-       range from 0-200% of carrying capacity.
-    - Packages with a higher version than another enabled package by the same name
-       will automatically override the lower versioned package.
-    - Misspelled dot-commands will no longer display, so no more embarrassment
-       in mixed company when I leave an 'o' out of '.objcount'
-
-
-05/23/2000 - POLC089
-==========
-    Script functions can be passed parameters by reference.
-      put 'byref' in the function declaration before the parameter name.
-      function foo( pa, byref pb, pc )
-          pa := 5;
-          pb := 6;
-          pc := 7;
-      endfunction
-      var a := 12;
-      var b := 13;
-      var c := 14;
-      foo(a,b,c);
-      // at this point a and c are unchanged, b is 6
-      Note - it's much more efficient to pass arrays by reference than
-        by value, because pass-by-reference doesn't have to copy them
-        (or destroy them when it's done)
-    Mobilerefs and Itemrefs can be compared for equality directly
-      - so you can write &quot;if (me = you)&quot; instead of &quot;if (me.serial = you.serial)&quot;
-      - as a result, mobilerefs and itemrefs can be used as keys in dictionaries.
-    Linux version - gump problems, text command, MT mode problems fixed
-    Added mobile.title_prefix, mobile.title_suffix, mobile.title_guild, mobile.title_race
-      - mobile.title_prefix is displayed before the name on the paperdoll
-      - mobile.title_suffix is displayed after the name on the paperdoll
-      - mobile.title_guild and mobile.title_race are not used (but are persisted)
-    Added mobile.GuildId : just a numeric guild identifier
-      (not sure if this is how it'll be done, but this lets me start on highlighting etc)
-    config/repsys.cfg will be required by the core
-    MoveMode can be specified in npcdesc.cfg.
-      - This is per-NPC -- changing npcdesc.cfg will not affect existing NPCs
-      - MoveMode is a string, containing one or more of the following:
-        - &quot;L&quot; - Moves on Land (this is the default)
-        - &quot;S&quot; - Moves on the Sea
-        - &quot;A&quot; - Moves in the Air
-      - Mobiles require MoveMode 'L' to move on land.
-      - Mobiles require MoveMode 'S' to move on the sea.
-      - MoveMode A doesn't have any effect yet.
-      - There is no script interface to this yet.
-      - an example - &quot;MoveMode LS&quot; would be appropriate on a Water Elemental.
-      - PCs are all MoveMode L, unless you edit pcs.txt...
-    Added combat.cfg:WarmodeInhibitsRegen (default false)
-    Linux version: corrected an error in CreateAccount that would empty the account file (!)
-    Corrected bug where Paperdoll would display warmode when you weren't
-    'IP' entries in servers.cfg can be hostnames.  A DNS lookup will be performed each time
-      a client connects to the loginserver.
-    CInt(), CDbl(), and Hex() will all operate on Substrings
-    Mobiles without MoveMode L might not be able to move on land.
-    Added account.GetProp(propname)
-    Added account.SetProp(propname,propval)
-    Added 'DefaultPrivs' and 'DefaultCmdLevel' properties to entries in data/accounts.txt
-      - there is no script interface.
-      - these are assigned to new characters for the account.
-    object method name searches are now case-insensitive
-        - so now you can write array.size() or array.Size()
-        - this is really so you can write account.GetProp etc
-    object method names can be the same as system or user functions
-    account.SetName should work now (account.SetAcctName has been renamed to this)
-    Added some more log output when message handlers crash
-    Added FindAccount( acctname )
-    Added ListAccounts()
-    Added account.GetCharacter( index : 1..5 ) -- for offline access to PCs
-    Fixed the &quot;server full&quot; bug when --ip-- and --lan-- were used in servers.cfg
-    ECOMPILE_PATH_EM and ECOMPILE_PATH_INC environment variables are now unnecessary
-      if they would have referred to the directory where the 'ecompile' executable is.
-    ecompile now creates '.dep' files so that changed .inc files will be searched for
-      on '-u' (update) runs. ('ecompile -u -r .')
-      If no .dep file exists for a .src file, no dependencies are assumed - so in order
-      for this to work properly, run 'ecompile -b -r .' to recompile everything once.
-    Added http::QueryIP(), returns IP address of connecting browser.
-    PrintTextAbove and PrintTextAbovePrivate will use the correct description,
-      rather than always using the text from tiledata.mul
-    Added account.DeleteCharacter( index : 1..5 )
-    Added account.EraseProp( propname : string )
-    cfgfile::GetConfigStringKeys and cfgfile::GetConfigIntKeys should work now.
-    Added CChr, CAsc, CChrZ, CAscZ
-    ecompile will optimize IF statements with constant test expressions
-    substring access with out-of-bound indices will return an error rather than aborting the script
-    start_script will return an error rather than aborting the calling script.
-    Fixed a problem involving dictionaries, persistence, and substrings.

-04/08/2000 - POLC088
-==========
-    Fixed a crash bug when an item was destroyed while equipped on an offline mobile
-    Fixed a crash bug when an error occurred reading properties for a new NPC
-    Added mobile.hp_regen_rate, mobile.mana_regen_rate, and mobile.stamina_regen_rate.
-      - a value of '100' adds one point every five seconds.
-      - a value of '50' adds one half point every five seconds.
-      - ...you see the pattern...
-      - applied fixes for negative regen rates, and regen rates for new characters.
-    Added the BASIC-style FOR-loop to escript.
-      for i := 1 to 5
-         print(i);
-      endfor
-      is the syntax.
-    Added the 'dictionary' complex datatype for scripts.
-        usage:
-           var dict := dictionary;
-           dict[ &quot;green&quot; ] := &quot;blue&quot;;
-           dict[ &quot;red&quot; ] := &quot;orange&quot;;
-           dict[ 12 ] := &quot;yellow&quot;;
-           print( dict[ &quot;green&quot; ] );
-           print( dict[ &quot;red&quot; ] );
-        methods:
-           dictionary.size()        : number of elements
-           dictionary.erase( key )  : erase an element
-           dictionary.insert( key, value ) : insert an element
-             (equivalent of dictionary[key] := value;)
-           dictionary.exists( key ) : check for existence of a key
-           dictionary.keys()        : return an array of all keys
-
-        dictionaries can be persisted.
-        keys can be integers, reals or strings.
-        values can be anything.
-    Added cfgfile::GetConfigStringKeys(config_file)
-    Added cfgfile::GetConfigIntKeys(config_file)
-    Packages can contain a 'www' directory.
-      (use URLs like &quot;<A HREF="http://127.0.0.1:8080/pkg/saver/">http://127.0.0.1:8080/pkg/saver/</A>&quot;)
-    www directories and subdirectories will be searched for index.ecl, then
-      index htm, if no page is specified.
-    Added item.invisible; only applies to items in the ground, and the same
-      deal with moving &quot;out of range&quot; after enabling the 'seeinvisitems' priv applies.
-    run_script_to_completion will return the 'return value' of the script it runs
-      (the return value is what the 'program' section returns)
-      it will return an error if the script does not exist.
-    Fixed bugs in gump handling
-    Fixed bug in GetWorldHeight (kept dungeon teleporters from working)
-
-03/05/2000 - POLC087
-==========
-    Removed annoying hit-script debug output
-    Added logon scripts, logoff scripts, reconnect scripts.
-    Added delayed logout (see docs/logonoff.txt)
-     - at a minimum, you will need scripts/misc/logofftest.* for this
-    Line-of-sight will succeed to items in your backpack.
-    Added the 'losany' privilege for letting you ignore LOS.
-    Multis will be checked in Line-of-Sight tests
-    PCs can now walk through items they can move.  Hopefully this means if
-      you're a GM and the client wants to let you walk through something,
-      the server will let you.
-    Added character.enabled( setting ) to allow scripts to check enabled settings
-    Added the 'ignoredoors' privilege to let you walk through doors if your
-      client files will allow it (requires a modified VERDATA.MUL)
-    config/cmds.cfg added - specifies cmdlevel names and textcmd directories.
-    character.setcmdlevel( cmdlevelname ) added - set cmdlevel by name
-    character.cmdlevelstr added - text name of the cmdlevel
-    textcmds can be specified in packages; just make a textcmd/gm etc directory
-     - these are only scanned at startup, so if the directory doesn't exist then,
-       it won't be searched until restart.
-    character.poisoned added - just makes your health bar green or not.
-     - this is not saved with world state.
-    Added a console keypress interface - see config/console.cfg
-    Fixed house-walking bug on restart
-    Added os::unload_scripts(scriptname)  -- see os.em
-    Added os::set_script_option(optnum,optval)  -- see os.em
-    Added uo::Shutdown()
-    Added character.ip (returns an empty string if no client connected)
-    Added a facility for banning logins by IP.  You'll need config/bannedips.cfg
-    MoveItemToLocation and MoveItemToContainer will check the 'moveany' setting of
-      the script controller.
-    EquipItem will check item movability
-    Server should no longer crash if you hit Ctrl-C while packages are loading
-    Added character.gold member
-    Added character.spendgold( amount ) method - spends nothing and returns error if
-      character doesn't have enough.  Does not recurse into locked containers.
-    Added uo::ConsumeSubstance( container, objtype, amount ) - consumes nothing and
-      returns error if container doesn't have enough. Does not recurse into locked containers.
-    MoveItemToContainer will no longer allow a container to be moved into itself,
-      or into a subcontainer in itself.
-    Automatic skill advancement when skill is below 10 will only occur
-      if you had some chance of success
-    Fixed some movement errors; it should be possible to walk into caves now.
-     - dropping things on the ground in caves probably doesn't work yet.
-    character.gender is now read/write
-    Items being dragged will be moved back into the backpack when a character dies
-     (so they'll be moved to the corpse or kept based on newbie status etc)
-
-02/01/2000 - POLC086
-==========
-    Inactivity timeout will not occur to those with cmdlevel &gt; 0
-    Inactivity timeout will not occur until a character is chosen or created
-    &quot;InactivityWarningTimeout&quot; and &quot;InactivityDisconnectTimeout&quot; in pol.cfg configure
-      the inactivity timeout in minutes.  Set either to 0 to disable.
-    pol.cfg will be checked for changes every 30 seconds.  Settings that can be changed
-      without restarting will be re-read.
-    Added map checking to correct LOS issues in dungeons.  (pol.cfg:ExpLosChecksMap=1/0)
-      - currently inhibits LOS across bodies of water, which may be bad.
-    Packet formats changed to match latest client
-      (skill locking stuff is ignored)
-    uo::SendSkillWindow( towhom, forwhom ) added.  A script could send you skills for
-      someone else, if it wanted; you'd get spurious &quot;skill value changed&quot; notifications,
-      but that's your choice.
-    scripts/misc/skillwin.ecl will be run on &quot;Skill Window&quot; (Alt-K) requests if present.
-    MoveItemToLocation takes a 5th parameter, 'flags'
-       - instead of adding MOVEITEM_FORCELOCATION to the z parameter, pass it here
-       - pass MOVEITEM_NORMAL or 0 for normal z-corrected movement
-       - for now, I'm making the 'flags' parameter mandatory, as all existing scripts
-         need to be changed.  Later I'll make flags default to 0.
-    Added EVID_DOUBLECLICKED event, sent when an NPC is doubleclicked
-      This event must be explicitly enabled with EnableEvents().
-    scripts/misc/skilladv.ecl will be run when a visible skill change happens
-      - parameters are (who, skillid)
-      - this is called for PCs and NPCs.
-    default 'facing' prop added to itemdesc.cfg
-    EquipTest scripts added - scripts/misc/equiptest and all package equiptest scripts
-      will be called to determine if an item can be equipped.
-    The 'mount' layer (25) can now be equipped.
-      - lots of issues are left yet - combat effects, what happens when you die, and so on.
-    pol.cfg:MinCmdlevelToLogin can specify the minimum cmdlevel allowed to log in.
-        (So you can set your server to GM-only access temporarily or whatever)
-    Objtype 0xF021 is now the 'mount' object type.
-        Add the following entry to itemdesc.cfg:
-            Item 0xF021
-            {
-                name    mount
-                graphic 0x3EA2
-            }
-        Graphic 0x3EA2 is a horse.  0x3E9F to 0x3EA6 will use other mount types.
-    Added uo::OpenPaperdoll( towhom, forwhom ).  Sends the paperdoll window.
-    scripts/misc/dblclickself.ecl will be executed when you doubleclick yourself,
-      if it exists.  The core will still handle &quot;Open Paperdoll&quot; macro requests
-      internally.  The basic doubleclick-self script would look like this:
-            use uo;
-
-            program dblclickself( me )
-                OpenPaperdoll( me, me );
-            endprogram
-    Weapons can specify MountedAnim in itemdesc.cfg.
-    config/animxlate.cfg specifies animation translations for actions while on
-      a mount.  Most weapons shouldn't need MountedAnim entries if this is
-      populated correctly. (thanks to Myrathi for filling in animxlate.cfg)
-    Removed messages when skillwin.ecl and skilladv.ecl don't exist
-    Fixed a crash bug if you tried to spend gold with no backpack.
-    The game clock will be paused during world save.  This should eliminate CPU
-      usage spikes afterwards.
-    Script compiler takes two new parameters:
-        -b : keep building other scripts after errors are encountered
-        -u : only compile updated scripts (.src newer than .ecl)
-    Script compiler will warn for locals with same name as globals
-      (only if -w 'enable warnings' option is passed)
-    Crypto Keys updated for client 1.26.4
-
-
-10/28/1999 - POLC085
-==========
-    Fixed a bug where dragging part of a stack from the ground would
-      misplace the remainder.
-    Items that are 'SaveOnExit 0' and in a container will no longer be saved.
-
-10/25/1999 - POLC084
-==========
-    script compiler: '\' will function as an escape character in strings
-      - \n and \t are defined as special characters
-    script compiler: *.hsr files are ASP-like source pages
-     (see files in the experimental files section for examples)
-    added http::WriteHtmlRaw(str) for .hsr/.asp pages
-    script scheduler uses a priority divider now; will be testing to see
-      if this can help with lag in some instances
-    polcore().set_priority_divide( newvalue ) added
-    polcore().priority_divide (read-only)
-    script compiler will generate a wordlist file if '-W' option is passed.
-    added mobile.criminal property
-    when loading, 1 dot will print per 1000 objects loaded.
-    Fixed a bug in array.insert(index,value) where it was impossible
-      to insert at the end of an array, or into an empty array.
-    Added array.append(value), array.reverse(), and array.sort() methods
-    Inactivity timer added: warning after 4 minutes, disconnect after 5 mins
-    MaxCallDepth for scripts can be specified in pol.cfg (default 100)
-!!  Decreased system load time.  Please BACK UP your datafiles!
-    IgnoreLoadErrors=1 in pol.cfg will ignore (most) load errors and start server
-    Script listfiles generated with -l with always contain source and
-      file/line information, even if -i is not specified
-      (it's best not to use -i, in fact -- less overhead)
-    Added polcore().script_profiles property:
-      returns array of { name, instr, invocations, instr_per_invoc, instr_percent }
-      - same data as output by .log_profile
-    Added polcore().clear_script_profile_counters() method.
-    array.insert() functions properly again
-    Overhauled the client item manipulation system (getting,dropping,equipping items):
-      - LOS is now checked when picking up an item
-      - LOS is checked when dropping an item
-      - range must be &lt;= 2 to pick up an item
-      - drop-item range increased to 2
-      - picked up items are marked 'inuse'
-        Note this causes some easy resource-use exploits until scripts mark
-        items in-use.  But that's better than crashing.
-    Added uo::ReserveItem(item) and uo::ReleaseItem(item)
-      - these mark an item as inuse for this script only to use.
-      - all reserved items will be released on script exit if ReleaseItem is not called.
-    'inuse' items have special rules:
-      - they cannot be picked up (not even part of a stack)
-      - they cannot be added to, if they're a stack.
-      - they cannot be used as reagents
-      - they cannot be used as projectiles
-      - they cannot be spent at a vendor
-      - they cannot be sold to a vendor
-      - they will not decay
-      - if a stack, they cannot be added to if a like item is bought at a vendor
-      - The following functions will not operate on inuse items, unless the calling
-        script reserved the item for its use with ReserveItem
-          - DestroyItem
-          - SubtractAmount
-          - MoveItem
-          - MoveItemToContainer
-          - EquipItem
-        This means most scripts that have to check for materials twice (typically
-        before and after doing sound effects and delays) can just reserve the items
-        before checking for materials.
-
-      I'm considering whether inuse items should be doubleclickable, and
-        whether or not the doubleclick script should start out with the
-        item already reserved.
-     MoveCharacterToLocation and login will generate EVID_ENTEREDAREA events
-     Ghosts will no longer use nor require stamina for movement
-
-
-10/07/1999 - POLC083
-==========
-    Lots of items down there.  The highlights:
-        - secure trading (but see important note about enabling)
-        - stamina costs for movement
-
-    Startup output -- error messages, etc will be logged to 'start.log'.
-    Disabled the following internal text commands, because a replacement
-      script exists, or they're rarely used and a script could be written.
-      (They still exist; renamed to i_[cmd] in case you really need them)
-        .ident
-        .setusescript
-    Added polcore() members:
-        log_profile( clear )
-    text command script names can now contain underscores
-    New config file - config/servspecopt.cfg, for Server Specific Options
-       - DefaultDoubleclickRange, which is used if DoubleclickRange isn't
-         specified for an objtype in itemdesc.cfg
-       The default doubleclick range (if not specified there) is now 2
-    GMs should still see ghosts after they drop out of warmode
-    added mobile.enable( privilege ), mobile.disable( privilege )
-       - for enabling/disabling privileges
-    Added functions to the NPC module:
-        WalkTowardLocation( x, y );
-        WalkAwayFromLocation( x, y );
-        RunTowardLocation( x, y );
-        RunAwayFromLocation( x, y );
-        TurnTowardLocation( x, y );
-        TurnAwayFromLocation( x, y );
-    polcore().itemcount will now decrease
-    Added 'ipmatch' property to servers.cfg, so localhost and LAN servers
-      can be made to only show up if you connect from localhost or the lan.
-    Added the 'all' privilege which effectively gives you..all the privileges!
-    Added the 'dblclickany' privilege which lets you doubleclick any
-      doubleclickable object regardless of range
-    itemdesc.cfg has a 'Weight' entry which can specify whole weights
-      or fractional weights (&quot;1/50&quot; etc) in stones
-    Item weights will be tracked.  No limits or stamina effects yet.
-    added 'object.weight' member
-    Fixed an integrity problem if doors were on a zone boundary
-    Fixed a crash bug if a house component was destroyed before the house was.
-    Items will not decay on multis unless &quot;DecayOnMultis 1&quot; is set in itemdesc.cfg
-!       (Note this should be set for corpses in particular)
-    Gave boats some TLC: (some scripts+config files need updated to use this)
-       - corpses created on a boat will move with it.
-       - items dropped on the boat when a corpse decays will move with it
-       - the remainder of a stack half-removed from a deck will move with the boat
-       - NPCs created directly on boats will move with it
-       - added the rest of the boat definitions to config/boats.cfg
-       - walkon scripts will fire if the item's Z is 0 or 1-z below the walker
-          (specifically so that boat planks can have walkon scripts)
-       - massaged the data from client files so long boats don't have a hole in
-          the middle.
-       - fixed the &quot;Deck is not empty&quot; bug on boat destruction
-       - characters who log off on a boat will be moved when the boat moves
-       - added member 'boat.has_offline_mobiles'
-       - added method 'boat.move_offline_mobiles(x,y,z)' for moving the offline
-         mobiles carried by a ship somewhere.  This function is very trusting
-         regarding the coordinates you pass it. As long as they're within the
-         world bounds, it'll move the mobiles there.
-    &quot;walkon&quot; scripts have more parameters.  the full declaration:
-       program walkon( who, what, lastx, lasty, lastz )
-       the 'last' coordinates are the coordinates the walker is coming from.
-    MoveCharacterToLocation takes a 5th parameter, 'flags'
-       if MOVEMOB_FLAG_FORCELOCATION included, force z-location
-         (ignore any obstacles)
-    Added polcore().packages() - array of installed package names
-    Added polcore().compiledate - text string
-    Added polcore().compiletime - text string
-    Incorporated Beosil's latest crypto code to deal with the 21036-bytes bug
-    Fixed a bug with gump-dialog handling for dialogs with many textentry fields
-    Package start scripts will run under the Linux build
-    Added basics of secure trading:
-        Enabled if EnableSecureTrading=1 is set in pol.cfg.
-        Items can be added to the secure trade window
-        Items cannot be removed except through cancelling the trade
-        Items in the secure trade window can be singleclicked
-        Unlocked containers in your side of the trade window can be
-          doubleclicked, and will open for both trading parties
-        stacks currently cannot be added to.
-        If either party disconnects, trade will be cancelled.
-        Traded items which will not fit in your backpack will fall to your feet.
-        All secure trades will be cancelled before saving data or shutting down.
-!       This entry must be added to config/itemdesc.cfg:
-            Container 0xFF01
-            {
-                Name    SecureTradeContainer
-                graphic 0x1E5E
-                Gump    0x003C
-                MinX    0
-                MaxX    66
-                MinY    0
-                MaxY    33
-            }
-    Added servspecopt.cfg property: MovementUsesStamina=0/1
-        If this is set, you will need config/movecost.cfg
-        Note movement cost code is still being developed.
-    ecompile: option -l  (ell) will cause a listfile to be generated, which
-      contains the internal instructions in the compiled file.  In conjunction
-      with '-i' (include debug info) you may have a fighting chance at seeing
-      where your script corresponds to the instructions.  May be useful
-      for debugging or profiling, or for just being nosy.
-    Added runaway script detection.  RunawayScriptThreshold in pol.cfg specifies
-      how many instructions a script can execute without sleeping before being
-      reported as a runaway.  The default is 5000 instructions.  Reports will
-      be logged to log/script.log
-    spellbook weight will no longer include weight of contained scrolls
-    corrected an error in container-weight handling
-    added polcore().running_scripts
-    returns an array of structures { name, instr_cycles, consec_cycles, PC, call_depth, num_globals },
-      one element per running script.  See scripts/www/running_scripts.src
-    pol.cfg can specify WebServerPassword=username:password, to restrict access
-      If this is used, nothing can be accessed without the password.
-      A more flexible password scheme is in design.
-
-
-09/09/1999 - POLC082
-==========
-    Added 'hearghosts' privilege
-    Support added for UO client 1.26.1
-      - key constants are specified in a key file, so maybe next time
-        this won't require a rebuild.
-      - pol.cfg must have &quot;Keyfile=crypto/v1_26_1.key&quot;
-

-09/05/1999 - POLC081
-==========
-    Added cfgfile::LoadTusScpFile(basename) - loads TUS .SCP format files
-      so they can be accessed like a POL .cfg file
-      (not an importer - an importer will be built upon this)
-    New characters will start with clothing that matches what the new
-      client displays.
-    mobile.concealed can be set to anywhere between 0 and mobile.cmdlevel
-    mobile.concealed is now saved with game state
-    added array.erase( index ) - erases an element in an array
-    added array.size() - returns number of elements in an array
-    added array.shrink( nelems ) - erases all but the first 'nelems' elements
-    added array.insert( index, value ) - inserts an new element
-    NPC masters will be saved with game state
-    packages can contain npcdesc.cfg and ai scripts.. &quot;.createnpc :pkg:npctype&quot;
-    Encryption keys changed to support client 1.26b (Thanks Beosil!)
-    Added some code to get more information on a particular crash bug
-    Fixed an AV condition when equipping an NPC that isn't strong enough

-        mobile.setstr( newstrength )
-        mobile.setdex( newdexterity )
-        mobile.setint( newintelligence )
-
-08/28/1999 - POLC080
-==========
-    POL now supports the new UO Client (v 1.26)
-        startloc.cfg must be changed to list cities in a particular order.
-        (Yew, Minoc, Britain, Moonglow, Trinsic, Magincia, Jhelom, Skara Brae, Vesper)
-    Armor now has quality, hp, and maxhp.  This means Armor entries in
-      itemdesc.cfg must have a MaxHP entry!
-
-    Added polcore().version (79,80,81 etc)
-    Added polcore().verstr (&quot;POL080&quot;, &quot;POL080X1&quot; etc)
-    POL version string will be written to log file on startup
-    Added CreateAccount( acctname, password, enabled )
-      - returns an accountref (see docs/objref/account.htm)
-    character.acct added
-    Account object created; gives the ability to ban,unban, disable, enable,
-      change the account name, and change the account password, from scripts.
-    Large shards will want to set UseNewStaticsFile=1 in pol.cfg.  This will
-      create files 'statics0.pol' and 'staidx0.pol', which are smaller versions
-      of statics0.mul and staidx0.mul.  These files are then loaded wholly into
-      memory for very fast access for walking height and LOS checks.
-      If this option is enabled, POL uses an additional 11 MB memory
-    NPC movement anchors can be set; call npc::SetAnchor() (see npc.em)
-      Movement anchors are only in effect when NPC isn't in warmode
-    &quot;.unload&quot; will now unload all scripts whos name contains the parameter
-      &quot;.unload ai&quot; will unload all scripts whos name contains 'ai', for example.

-      worn items.  (bug introduced in the 'newbie items' update)
-    Added weather effects, using static regions (regions/weather.cfg)
-    Armor will now take damage during combat
-    stackable weapons/armor in vendor inventories
-     (merchant.src must be changed to call CreateItemInInventory)
-    New priv/settings: seehidden, seeghosts
-    added character.setlightlevel( lightlevel, duration ) (mylight.src tests)
-      - sets personal light level for a period of time (duration in seconds)
-    DestroyMulti can destroy boats now (but use BoatFromItem..see destroyboat.src)
-    Fixed an object leak on house destruction
-    Paperdolls will only be opened for humans, ghosts, GMs, Lord British,
-      Lord Blackthorne, and Dupre
-    chrdeath.src has a second parameter, the character's ghost
-    Added chr.squelch(duration) - duration in seconds.  -1=forever, 0=off
-    added chr.squelched
-    &quot;[invulnerable]&quot;, &quot;[frozen]&quot;, and &quot;[squelched]&quot; tags will display
-      over affected mobiles when singleclicked.
-    Added SetRegionWeatherLevel(regionname,type,severity,aux,lightoverride)
-      - test/setweather.src tests
-
-08/16/1999 - POLC079
-==========
-    items on others' paperdolls within visual ranged can be singleclicked
-    If an equipped item can't be equipped on load, it'll be stuffed into the backpack
-      If the backpack is full, the server will refuse to start.
-    More error messages will print hex serial numbers now
-    It will be impossible to assign a blank name to a mobile, or a name
-      that begins with whitespace (this traps all-whitespace names)
-    All the houses should be creatable now.
-    Made a change that seems to help lag when lots of mobiles are on-screen at once
-    http::WriteHtml calls are now handled more efficiently
-    corrected anims for nonhumans using projectile weapons
-    'StrRequired' (Strength Requirement to Equip Item) can be specified in itemdesc.cfg
-    item.newbie added; 'newbie' items will stay with the ghost.
-    'Newbie' can be specified in itemdesc.cfg.  This is the default 'newbie' flag
-      for items of this type.  Typically set for spellbooks.
-      - newbie items stay with the ghost
-      - newbie stacks split turn into two newbie stacks
-      - a non-newbie item added to a newbie stack contaminates the newbie stack,
-        making it non-newbie
-      - the various CreateInContainer functions will not add to an existing newbie stack
-      - vendors won't buy newbie items
-    'BlocksCastingIfInHand' can be specified in itemdesc.cfg.  Both hands will be checked
-    for items after reagents are consumed but before mana is consumed
-    RequireSpellbooks can be specified in pol.cfg; default is 1
-      - Spellbooks, with scrolls, are required in order to cast spells if this is set.
-
-08/10/1999 - POLC078
-==========
-    added character.acctname
-    added weapon.dmg_mod (-32768 to +32767, but be gentle :)
-    added armor.ar_mod
-      Note if you change ar_mod on equipped armor, it won't reflect in your displayed
-      AR until you take the armor off and put it back on, but the change will
-      increase or decrease your protection immediately.
-    added armor.ar  (adjusted by ar_mod)
-    added armor.ar_base (unadjusted)
-    added nocast regions (will work for spells and scrolls, if they use StartSpellEffect)
-    SaveWorldState() will return an error if an exception occurs during world save
-      (instead of aborting the calling script)
-    added weapon.maxhp_mod
-    Scaled back optimizations so that crash dumps can give more information
-    Included more debug checks in the release version, to search for odd problems
-    corrected an out-of-bounds condition for mobiles near the edges of the world
-    Fixed a bug where boats could go off one side of the world a couple of tiles.
-    It is now impossible to use a skill or item during a casting delay
-    Houses can sit on slightly uneven ground; the z-coord can differ by up to 2
-    added item.sellprice; used instead of 'VendorSellsFor' if nonzero.
-      sellprice on a stack is the price for one unit
-    TwoHanded (0/1) can be set in itemdesc.cfg for weapons
-    Started on z-coord problems, but the map seems to sit above some statics *sigh*
-    Target() will accept TGTOPT_HARMFUL, TGTOPT_NEUTRAL, and TGT_HELPFUL in its
-     'options' parameter.  Harmful actions mark you criminal or aggressor according
-     to normal flagging rules.  Helpful actions on a criminal will mark you a criminal.
-     The criminal query window will pop up when appropriate if enabled on the client.
-    NPCs will get &quot;enteredarea&quot; and &quot;leftarea&quot; events when they move
-    alignment (good, neutral, evil) can be specified in npcdesc.cfg
-    actions for/against yourself or your pets will not affect criminal flags, etc
-    harmful actions against good-alignment NPCs will mark you criminal
-    helpful actions against evil-alignment NPCs will mark you criminal
-    internal command target cursors shouldn't interfere with script target cursors
-    Scripts have a 'controller' attached.  This is set to the spellcaster, or the
-      character doubleclicking the item, etc.  ApplyDamage and ApplyRawDamage now
-      send an EVID_DAMAGED event using the controller as ev.source
-    Added uo::SetScriptController(who) - should be used to set controllers for
-      traps and such
-    EVID_ENGAGED events will be sent to NPCs targetted with hostile actions
-    justice zone &quot;entering&quot; and &quot;leaving&quot; messages won't print if switching between
-      zones where the messages are the same
-    If 'enabled.pkg' exists in a package directory, the package will be enabled
-      regardless of Enabled=1/0 in pkg.cfg.  If 'disabled.pkg' exists, both these
-      will be ignored, and the package will be disabled.
-    It's now possible to set a mobile's colors above 0xfff
-    added mobile.cmdlevel; read-write, set to 0-5 (0-player, 5=test)
-
-07/27/1999 - POLC077
-==========
-    weapon skills, tactics, and parry will cause stat gain from combat
-      - note this is from ANY combat - GMs on rabbits, whatever.
-    transmission buffer size increased to handle huge gump dialogs
-    save time improved; tests show over 2x faster on Win98, almost 2x faster on WinNT
-    Fixed the &quot;you are already holding an item&quot; bug on disconnect while dragging an item
-    Unicode speech is now handled (ASCII character set only)
-    Tooltip text can be specified in itemdesc.cfg
-    'Name' can be specified as 'ObjtypeName' in itemdesc.cfg.  'ObjtypeName' is
-      preferred. 'Name' is deprecated, and will not be supported after core 079
-    Entries in pol.log will be timestamped
-    Added logging for login/logout (with IP), and incorrect password presentation.
-    new polcore() variables:
-        uptime:  system uptime in seconds
-        sysload: system load, 0-100
-    Limited the crash stack backtrace to 100 frames
-    LogSysload=1 in pol.cfg will cause sysload to be logged each minute
-    Corrected an error which could cause CPU usage to rise to 100% until shutdown
-    Removed dump of message type 0x69
-    New internal text command: &quot;log_profile&quot;  logs script profile data
-    New internal text command: &quot;log_profile_clear&quot;  logs script profile data, clears counters
-    new polcore() variables: bytes_sent, bytes_received
-    SendEvent now functions as advertised
-    new members for multis: multi.items and multi.mobiles
-      - arrays of supported items/mobiles
-    Names of scripts that cause access violations will now be logged.
-    Fixed an AV condition on skills with no script defined
-    Target() takes an 'options' parameter.  This should be either TGTOPT_CHECK_LOS or
-      TGTOPT_NOCHECK_LOS.  The default is TGTOPT_CHECK_LOS.  Some scripts currently
-      call Target( someone, &quot;&quot; ) -- this should be changed to Target( someone ) ASAP.
-      For now, this is treated the same as TGTOPT_CHECK_LOS.
-    Corrected another cause of client i/o thread infinite loops.
-    Autodefense will target an attackable opponent or hostile, rather than
-      exclusively trying to hit your opponent.
-    Added the beginnings of aggressor and criminal flagging.
-      Supported:
-        - criminal flagging (2 minutes) for attacking an innocent
-        - aggressor flagging (2 minutes) for attacking first
-        - extension of these timeouts for continued behavior
-        - pets ordered to attack will affect their owner's flags
-        - attacking a pet is like attacking the owner, as far as flagging is concerned
-        - name coloring
-      Not supported:
-        - any repercussions whatsoever for being a criminal
-            (except that others can attack you without becoming criminal)
-        - any repercussions whatsoever for being an aggressor
-            (except that those you are an aggressor to can attack you freely)
-    Corrected an error in the task scheduler, discovered while coding aggressor flagging.
-      This may also affect autodefense.
-    Ships will no longer be able to sail off the map
-
-07/06/1999 - POL076
-==========
-    data/accounts.txt will be re-read after it has been modified (must remain
-        unchanged for 10-40 seconds).
-    basic::pack( expr ) and basic::unpack( string ) added.
-    Config/Data file parser modified to handle arbitrarily long properties
-      (mostly for very large stored arrays)
-    Trailing spaces in config/data files will be trimmed.
-    arrays will display their contents when printed, instead of &quot;&lt;objarray&gt;&quot;
-    Weapons will have a 1% chance (was 25%) per swing of losing 1 HP
-    Temporary kludge for combat skill gain:
-        On each swing:
-            attacker gets 30 raw skill points in his weapon skill
-            attacker gets 15 raw skill points in tactics
-            defender gets 15 raw skill points in tactics
-            defender gets 30 points in parry, if a shield is equipped
-    GetObjProperty/SetObjProperty etc can store arrays of integers, strings, reals, and arrays
-    arrays can be tested for equality.
-    Fixed two memory leaks in the script compiler
-    Skill points will always be awarded for skills with &lt;= 10.0 value
-    items which are 'SaveOnExit 0' will use a different serial number pool,
-      from 0x4F000000 to 0x4FFFFFFF
-    bugfix: fixed some problems with LOS checks on doubleclick (and others)
-            if you stood in the same place as, say, an iron ingot, you couldn't
-            open a container in your backpack; this has been fixed.
-    ecompile can take '-r directory' as a parameter, will compile .src files in
-        directory and all subdirectories
-    bugfix: 'npctemplate' custom prop on corpses will now work.
-    Adding support for packages: see also polcore/docs/packages.txt for detail.:
-        - 'item.usescript' can specify ':pkgname:script' format scriptnames
-        - PKG.CFG can specify 'version', 'requires pkgname version', and 'conflicts pkgname'
-        - AppendConfigFileElem and UnloadConfigFile will accept &quot;:pkgname:cfgfile&quot; syntax
-        - Anywhere you can specify 'script' that would specify a script in a package,
-          you can now specify ':pkgname:script' to reference a script in another package
-        - Spells can be put in packages (put a spells.cfg in package directory)
-        - Packages can contain 'skills.cfg'
-        - ReadConfigFile( &quot;::itemdesc&quot; ) will access data in main itemdesc.cfg as well
-          as all package itemdesc.cfg files.  Same for &quot;::skills.cfg&quot; and &quot;::spells.cfg&quot;
-        - ReadConfigFile handles new formats to specify a config file in another package
-
-05/31/1999 - POL075
-==========
-    DoubleclickRange can be specified in itemdesc.cfg
-      (archery buttes will be broken until their configuration uses this)
-    Linux build: Ctrl-C and 'kill [pid]' are caught for save/shutdown
-    Added uo::polcore() - returns an object that can be used to query system data
-       - itemcount
-       - mobilecount
-    regions/regions.cfg defines justice regions - only enter/leave messages are printed.
-    regions/regions.cfg defines music regions
-    ListMobilesInLineOfSight will not return mobile passed as the center
-    Linux build: fixed bug which was causing 100% cpu usage always
-    Startup output for start.src will be shorter
-    Line of sight to items changed: will be from head of mobile to center of item
-    Doubleclick limits added: must be range &lt;= 1, and have LOS.
-    ~IN[spellnum] can be used to cast spells
-    Spells above the standard 64 can be defined (use ~IN to invoke)
-    NPCs have a 'setmaster(master)' method, which right now only allows renaming
-    Events sent to an NPC will be discarded if more than 30 events are currently queued
-    web server can now serve .gif, .jpg, and .jpeg files
-    scripts: &quot;var&quot; can be used instead of &quot;global&quot; and &quot;local&quot;
-    scripts: object methods are here - doors will have them first.
-    scripts: &quot;array(2, 54)&quot; syntax is deprecated in favor of &quot;{ 2, 54 }&quot;
-    scripts: C-style &quot; /*   */ &quot; comments will function again
-    scripts: old, non-&quot;fully bracketed&quot; syntax will no longer compile.
-    Custom properties prefixed with '#' will not be saved with game state.
-    SendDialogGump now returns an 'integer hash' with the results.
-        var x := SendDialogGump(...);
-        x[0] is the exit-button pressed
-        x[button id] returns 1 if that button was pressed/selected
-        x[text entry id] returns the string contents of a textentry field
-        x.keys returns an array of all the keys
-        See scripts/textcmd/test/exgump.*
-    Added GetWorldHeight(x,y) - returns lowest point above map and lowest statics
-        (It's supposed to, anyway.  It actually returns the point atop the
-         highest static, but it works for most dungeon teleporters, so I'm leaving
-         it broken for a while.)
-    internal changes to resource region stuff; more testing before X3
-    mid() is now unavailable (has always been broken)
-    ghosts will speak ghostspeech (no hooks for spirit speak yet)
-    doors are scriptable; door.src autocloses, and plays sound effects.
-      - door objects have an 'isopen' property
-      - door objects have 'open()', 'close()', and 'toggle()' methods
-      - 'isopen': reports if the door is open or closed
-      - 'open()': opens the door  (&quot;door.open();&quot; in script would open it)
-      - same for  'close()' and 'toggle()' - they change the state of the door.
-      Not sure how well this interface will work, or how intuitive it'll be.
-    bugfix: SetObjProperty etc now work with Multis
-    SystemFindObjectBySerial will find multis
-
-05/18/1999 - POL074
-==========
-    Spawner rewritten; basic spawn limiting is in place.
-    EVID_ITEM_GIVEN event added for items dragged onto NPCs
-    Wrestling will no longer do 0 damage after being used a few times
-    item colors set by scripts will be limited to 0-0xFFF
-    The following types of scripts run at priority 100, instead of critical:
-      - spells
-      - item use
-      - walk on
-      - skill use
-      - text commands
-    The following types of scripts still run critical:
-      - character creation
-    DestroyMulti will destroy houses, moving their contents to the ground.
-    NPCs will have a &quot;.npctemplate&quot; member
-    &quot;CacheInteractiveScripts&quot; in pol.cfg forces disk reloads on use for some scripts:
-      - text commands
-      - item use
-      - walk on
-      - character creation
-      - www pages
-      - spells
-      - skill use
-    Added uo::StartSpellEffect(who,spellid): start the spell script
-    Added uo::GetSpellDifficulty(spellid)
-    Added uo::SpeakPowerWords(who,spellid)
-    Corrected an error where config file/elem variables couldn't be passed to functions
-    spawns.cfg can take 'rect' entries
-    combat.cfg has a param for displaying a message on successful parry.
-    Multithread mode is stable.
-    CDbl(val) added - convert to double
-    &quot;.setskill&quot; now takes base-values instead of raw-values, so
-      &quot;.setskill 25 60&quot; will set Magery to 60.  It'll actually set it to
-      59.9, because of a base-&gt;raw conversion bug, so don't panic.
-    Fixed a resource leak if you set 'decayat' on an object...don't ask.
-    More stuff for houses:
-      - Empty space is required between houses:
-        - 2 tiles east-west
-        - 6 tiles north-south
-      - Houses cannot be built on top of mobiles or items.
-      - Houses must sit on level ground.
-      - Houses cannot sit on trees, rocks etc, or have them directly adjacent to it.
-      - Note, it's still possible to create houses in annoying places.. *sigh*
-    'cprop' and 'strprop' entries in itemdesc.cfg will be added to new items
-    Internal clock granularity is now 1/100th second.
-    CreateMultiAtLocation will function for houses, and will create doors and signs.
-      - house.components will be an array of all these items
-      - each component will have a 'house_serial' custom prop with the serial #
-        of the house.
-
-05/09/1999 - POL073
-==========
-    Rudimentary web server added.  Set WebServer=1, WebServerPort=8080 in pol.cfg,
-      then go to <A HREF="http://localhost:8080.">http://localhost:8080.</A>  The default website only has a
-      &quot;show online characters&quot; page, but that's just the beginning!
-      This only works in multithread mode, which is unstable on exit,
-        so this is really only for playing around at this point.
-      Default operations allows access only from localhost.
-    Weapon animations can be set - 'Anim' in wepndesc.cfg
-    Weapon sounds can be set - 'HitSound', 'MissSound' in wepndesc.cfg
-    NPCs will no longer step into the same tile as another NPC.
-    WebServerLocalOnly (defaults to 1) in pol.cfg will restrict web server access
-    &quot;AttackHitSound&quot; and &quot;AttackMissSound&quot; can be specified in npcdesc.cfg
-      - Note that to do this, you have to have an AttackSpeed entry too
-    Added uo::SendTextEntryGump() - used for those input box thingies
-      - see uo.em for parameters and constants
-      - Added &quot;.testtextentry&quot; to play with it
-      - numerical mode isn't tested yet, but will for sure return result as a string
-    Added uo::SendDialogGump( who, layout, textlines ) - see uo.em and testgump.src
-       We need more 'testgump' scripts for radio buttons etc
-    RandomInt() will return an error if its parameter is &lt;= 0
-    Performance enhancements to PC movement with lots of ingame items
-    The following functions will automatically convert a 'name' to an 'objtype'
-      (they automatically call GetObjtypeByName if a string is passed)
-      - CreateItemAtLocation
-      - AddMenuItem
-      - ListItemsNearLocationOfType
-      - CreateItemInContainer
-      - CreateRootItemInStorageArea
-      - FindObjtypeInContainer
-      - CreateItemInBackpack
-    &quot;.createstack&quot; can take an objname
-    &quot;Movable&quot; property added to itemdesc.cfg - overrides client datafiles
-    Item descriptions in merchant windows will no longer include redundant amounts
-    &quot;Desc&quot; property in itemdesc.cfg will now be used
-    &quot;MOVEITEM_FORCELOCATION&quot; can be added to the z-coordinate in
-      MoveItemToLocation to force acceptance of the position.
-    ControlScript in itemdesc.cfg is now functional
-    CreateScript in itemdesc.cfg fill now run for:
-      - CreateItemAtLocation
-      - CreateItemInContainer
-      - CreateItemInBackpack
-      If the CreateScript succeeds (returns a 'true' value, or nothing) creation
-      will be allowed; if it returns a 'false' value, creation will fail.
-    DestroyItem will consult the DestroyScript, if any
-    Decay will consult DestroyScript, if any.  Decay counter is not reset;
-      checks will continue on each decay sweep.
-    os::parameter() is gone
-    Added os::set_priority( priority ) - set script priority from 1 to 255
-      - higher priority scripts will get more CPU time
-      - in CS terms, priority is just quanta
-
-
-
-04/29/1999 - POL072 (ouch, too many changes! sorry!)
-==========
-    dot-commands will no longer unhide the character issuing them
-    'stealthsteps' member added to mobiles
-    GameMasters and ghosts can walk through doors
-      GM is defined as graphic == 0x3db, not humans wearing a GM robe
-    NPC stats in NPCDESC will be specified in die-roll, base values
-     (to come: hp, mana, stamina default to associated attributes)
-    'Unhides' property added to skills.cfg, mainly for stealth
-
-    Fixed an AV condition if a stat window was opened on a just-dead NPC
-    Skill values in NPCDESC.CFG are now 'base' values, dieroll-form
-    Skill values in NPCDESC.CFG can be named using Skill Name (skills.cfg)
-      rather than skillid (for example, Wrestling instead of Skill43)
-    Skill values in PCS.TXT and NPCS.TXT will use skill names (and raw values)
-    'concealed' flag added to mobiles.  Similar to 'hidden', but is only
-      cleared explicitly (who.concealed := 0).  Only effective against
-      mobiles below your command level - so Admins can always see GMs, etc.
-      The following functions will _always_ exclude 'concealed' mobiles:
-        ListMobilesNearLocationEx
-        ListMobilesNearLocation
-        ListMobilesInLineOfSight
-        ListHostiles
-        Note that these affect spells cast by higher-level beings.
-    Speech code modified to accomodate 'concealed' flag.  A side effect is
-      that speech by non-warmode ghosts should no longer be seen by non-ghosts
-    Some events will not be generated for hidden and concealed mobiles:
-       - speech
-       - entered area, left area
-       - opponent moved
-    'frozen' and 'paralyzed' members added to mobiles
-      - paralyzed is cleared when ApplyRawDamage is called
-      - paralyzed and frozen are cleared upon death and resurrection
-      - either block:
-        - walking and running (MoveCharacter() functions will still work)
-        - casting
-        - skill use
-        - item doubleclick (except paperdoll)
-        - targetting of any kind
-    '.freeze' and '.thaw' GM commands added
-
-    armor.cfg moved to armrdesc.cfg
-      format merged with itemdesc.cfg
-          &quot;.armor&quot; is gone = &quot;.create&quot; can do it now.
-
-    weapon.cfg moved to wepndesc.cfg
-      format merged with itemdesc.cfg
-      ripples to:
-          equipfromtemplate
-          &quot;.weapon&quot; is gone - &quot;.create&quot; should be able to do it now
-      Instead of WeaponTemplate names, weapons can just use different objtypes
-        to have different capabilities with the same graphic
-      This opens the door for magic weapons etc.
-
-    Experimental multithreading mode: Multithread=1 in pol.cfg
-      It's pretty unstable, typically crashing on exit.  Singlethread (default)
-      mode is unaffected.
-    Config properties can be accessed with &quot;.&quot; syntax, rather than using
-      &quot;GetConfigInt&quot;, &quot;GetConfigString&quot; etc.  Types (integer, string, real)
-      determined automatically.
-    Config files can be searched for elements with &quot;[]&quot; syntax:
-      config[6] searches by integer key, config[&quot;WarAxe&quot;] searches by string
-    SendSellWindow() sort of works; any merchant will buy and item with a
-      nonzero &quot;VendorBuysFor&quot; price in itemdesc.cfg.
-!!  Be sure to recompile merchant.src
-    MoveToward etc will move around simple obstacles
