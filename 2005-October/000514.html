+    This text is included with Brain 5 for historical reference. Please note 
+    that the contents are mostly valid, however they were written for Brain 4.x 
+    and its previous versions. &lt;br&gt;
+    The below text is pasted from the above URL on the
+    &lt;a href=&quot;<A HREF="http://www.polserver.com">http://www.polserver.com</A>&quot;&gt;<A HREF="http://www.polserver.com&lt;/a">http://www.polserver.com&lt;/a</A>&gt; forums.&lt;p&gt;
+    The text, made by Birdy, explains in an easy way what the brain is about and 
+    what the ideas behind it are. &lt;/p&gt;
+    &lt;p&gt;[
+    &lt;a href=&quot;<A HREF="http://www.polserver.com/modules.php?name=Forums&amp;file=viewtopic&amp;t=508">http://www.polserver.com/modules.php?name=Forums&amp;file=viewtopic&amp;t=508</A>&quot;&gt;
+    <A HREF="http://www.polserver.com/modules.php?name=Forums&amp;amp;file=viewtopic&amp;amp;t=508&lt;/a">http://www.polserver.com/modules.php?name=Forums&amp;file=viewtopic&amp;t=508&lt;/a</A>&gt; ]
+    &lt;/p&gt;
+    &lt;hr&gt;
+    &lt;p&gt;There is no real documentation outside of the package itself. However, 
+    the package itself, in the code, is pretty well documented. So it shouldn't 
+    be that hard to figure out what exactly is going on. &lt;/p&gt;
+    &lt;p&gt;The AI_Brain package is basically a package that uses dictionaries for 
+    it's database of scripts, and messages to know which ones to call and to 
+    receive instruction from those scripts. &lt;/p&gt;
+    &lt;p&gt;At it's heart, the brain.src script is your one true &quot;npc script&quot;. It 
+    includes an include which includes npc.em, and it is the script which does 
+    all direct communication with the npc reference. It is also generic enough 
+    that you should really never have to touch it for the most part. It 
+    basically receives events from the npc object and uses those to determine 
+    which scripts it will start off. Those scripts are started, and the events 
+    appropriate to that script are passed along to it by the brain. That script 
+    operates more or less independently, having received initially a structure 
+    with the npc reference in it, and the event that started it off. If you 
+    process events within that script, you will receive the events that the 
+    brain is forwarding along to your script. In order to &quot;command&quot; the npc to 
+    do things, your script usually includes npc_commands.inc. This is a set of 
+    functions which basically packages up an event for each type of standard 
+    npc.em function, and sends an event for each one off to the brain. The brain 
+    processes these events, and executes the appropriate npc.em functionality.
+    &lt;/p&gt;
+    &lt;p&gt;That is a basic understanding of what it is all about, and if you look at 
+    brain.src and the various include files when appropriate, you should be able 
+    to see all of this taking place and put it all together as to exactly how it 
+    is happening. The brain package is a little less efficient than typical AI, 
+    and it can also run into problems if the event queue's get clogged with 
+    messages. But it's true glory is in it's generic encapsulation. With it, you 
+    can have a bunch of npc's that are very similar except, perhaps, use 
+    different combat scripts, and all you have to do is write the individual 
+    combat scripts, rather than having to re-write an entirely new AI script. 
+    The old AI scripts could be approached similarly once you understood the 
+    various nested includes, but they were far more convoluted and difficult to 
+    follow than the brain's method. But also keep in mind that seperate scripts 
+    offers the flexibility(and complexity) of doing things relatively 
+    independently of having to worry about the main AI. So, for instance, the 
+    brain will send combat events to the combat script, and that is what will 
+    keep your npc fighting, following, etc, but it will still also send speech 
+    events to the listen script. So your npc can be fighting, and talking, at 
+    the same time, without having to include &quot;talking logic&quot; within the combat 
+    code. With the standard AI, you would either have an NPC that didn't speak 
+    while fighting, or one that had to have that code imbedded not only in the 
+    main AI loop, but also the combat loop. With the brain AI, the brain fires 
+    off events to the appropriate scripts, starting off the scripts if 
+    necessary, and those scripts run independantly of one another(unless you 
+    make them rely on each other for some reason, or in some manner).&lt;/p&gt;
+    &lt;p&gt;While adding some overhead to AI in it's pre-processing of events and 
+    multiple scripts to handle them, the brain package does provide quite a bit 
+    of easy flexibility to make your npc a little easier to manage.&lt;/p&gt;
+    &lt;hr&gt;
+    &lt;p&gt;Brain_AI is an &quot;AI system&quot; that is very different architecturally from 
+    the current distro AI. So far as I understand, it is the only other released 
+    AI system for POL, although undoubtably other people have written their own 
+    from ground up and just not released them.&lt;/p&gt;
+    &lt;p&gt;It attempts, and often succeeds, at taking the highly convoluted and 
+    complex task of operating your NPC's and makes that task into a fairly 
+    modular approach. In doing so, it makes alot of things much easier and even 
+    simply doable. &lt;/p&gt;
+    &lt;p&gt;You really have to probably pick it up for yourself however and try it 
+    out. It can work fine right along side of the distro AI, so you can just 
+    create a new NPC in npcdesc.cfg which uses the brain_AI to control it. So 
+    give it a try is the best advice.&lt;/td&gt;
+  &lt;/tr&gt;
+&lt;/table&gt;
+
+&lt;/body&gt;
