-Guard Nodes:
-  The Guard Node is objtype 0x887b.
-  Overview:
-    guard nodes are items used to control and spawn guards in all the cities.
-  Features:
-    guard nodes listen to speech events in a radius of 30 tiles.
-    guard nodes search for criminals in a radius of 30 tiles.
-    guard nodes recieve events from merchant nodes.
-    guard nodes send events to nearby guards to attack criminals
-    guards do not listen directly for guard calls, so they consume less 
-      CPU cycles
-    guards do listen for certain keywords at a very close range. so a player
-      must be close to them to get a response
-    guard nodes spawn their own guards as needed, and will replace any guards
-      that may be killed in the line of duty.
-    it is very difficult to kill a town guard as they will heal and cure
-      themselves if they reach half health or are poisoned
-  Installation:
-    guard nodes must be setup in a grid in all guard protected cities..
-    since guard nodes have a listen range of 30 tiles diamater, they should 
-      be placed in the following manner:
-      place nodes from the west side of town to the east.
-      find the town border and travel east 30 tiles
-      then find the north border and travel south 30 tiles
-      place a node there, the node will spawn its own guard
-      then travel 60 tiles south and place another node (30 tile radius 
-        for each node)
-      continue until you reach the south border of town
-      any guard nodes that extend past the town border will only work within
-        the actual town limits, so you dont have to worry about extending past 
-        town limits. 
-      (Guard zones are defined in config/gzone.cfg.)
-      for each node you have placed continue the above grid to the east till you
-        hit the east edge of town. once you fill in the grid, your town will be 
-        completely covered.
-Merchant Nodes:
-  The Merchant Node is objtype 0x887a.
-  Overview:
-    merchant nodes handle all speech events for npcs that interact regularly with
-      players. bankers, stablemasters, and all normal merchants are controlled
-      under this system. These npcs WILL NOT interact with players if they are
-      not controlled by a merchant node.
-
-  Features:
-    merchant nodes control all vendor restocking, and will queu restock cycles so 
-      they dont happen all at once, thus distributing system load over a longer 
-      period of time.
-    merchant nodes do all listening for their linked merchants.. the merchants 
-      themselves no longer handle speech events.. This results in lower overall
-      CPU utilization and much more user-friendly interaction for the players in
-    Only the closest npc within LOS and no greater than 4 tiles away from
-      the player will recieve the speech event, so you can always choose
-      which npc you wish to interact by positioning yourself closest to him.
-    vendors will keep items sold to them from players, and will alter the buy/sell
-      price of those items to reflect quality and condition. If a vendor does not
-      sell the item after 2 restock cycles, he will liquidate the items back into
-      gold currency to use for replenishing his stock and buying new goods.. 
-    vendors have a limited amount of gold to work with.. as a vendor buys and sells
-      goods, his pool of available gold will increase or decrease.. players that
-      sell tons of items to npcs will find that the npc cannot afford to purchase
-      anymore, and may not be able to afford to restock his normal stock items
-      (vendors spend their profit to restock their own regular inventory). once a 
-      vendor runs out of money, he must sell some of his current stock before he
-      can restock to normal levels..
-    when a vendor sells out of a particular item in a given stock cycles, he will
-      attempt to purchase an increased amount during his next restock.. this amount
-      may increase up to 20 X his base value.. if a vendor does not sell the
-      elevated items, he will stop stocking them until he reaches his base inventory
-      and then continue from that base.. 
-  Installation:
-    to install a merchant node, you must know the following information before you 
-    begin:
-      largest radius of the room to monitor. this can be determined by standing in
-      the exact center of the room and counting the tiles to the farthest wall.
-      keep in mind that the nodes check line of sight, so for buildings that are not
-      rectangular, you must base your centering on the assumption that the building
-      is rectangular. once you have your radius figure, you must create your npcs..
-      note that npcs are designed to be permanent and should not be created with a 
-      spawner, just use .createnpc.
-      once the npcs are created, you can use the .createnode command to begin setting
-      up the node.
-    creation:
-      the createnode gump is pretty straight forward. simply fill in the radius in
-      the spot provided and choose wether the node controls merchants or bankers.
-      setting a node to &quot;banker&quot; will cause the node to not attempt to run restock
-      so do not use this setting on normal merchants.
-      the &quot;next respawn&quot; field is the amount of time between restocks in minutes.
-      each npc will restock his inventory on that interval. the default of 30 minutes
-      is recommended for all merchants except reagent vendors which seem to work best
-      at 12 minute restock intervals.
-      once all the relevant information is entered, choose &quot;okay&quot;.
-      the first target cursor is for selecting where the cursor appears.. this must be
-      set at the center of the room, even if it is within a wall or outside the actual 
-      building. once the node is placed, after the node is placed, another cursor will 
-      appear, these cursors must be targeted once each on the merchants/bankers that
-      you have previously created. once you have targeted all the npcs you wish that
-      node to control, cancel the cursors and the node should turn green.. once the 
-      node turns green, it is active and ready to use.. if the node turns purple, it 
-      means the node is improperly configured and must be destroyed and recreated.
-      Soon a more user friendly version that is easier to setup will be released in 
-      a distro service pack.

-Notes:
-Never use GetObjProperty, SetObjProperty, EraseObjProperty and GetObjPropertyNames.
-Use GetProperty, SetProperty, EraseProperty and GetPropertyNames from properties.inc instead.
-This is for security reasons.

-Avoid using SendSysMessage and Broadcast. Use SendMessage and SendAll from
